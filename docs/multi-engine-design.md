# Multi-engine architecture (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB)

Status: **design; P1a, P1b, P2a and P2b implemented on branch `v2` (PostgreSQL still behind the preview flag). Revision 3** (2026-10-07): the product is now
called **Vortaq** (formerly ElectronDB, and Navidog before that); revision 3 renames it, removes
the Navicat Keychain recovery (section 12.3) and limits the sources to the ones in section 19.
Revision 2 (2026-10-05, at `c147306`) answered two reviews: an adversarial review (guard bypasses,
regressions, security) and a daily-use review by a heavy user of desktop database clients. Every
point of both reviews is accepted or rejected, with a one-line reason, in **section 20
(Decisions)**. Line references such as `types.ts:28-50` point to `c147306`.

The facts this design depends on are written inline so the document stands on its own. They come
from the project's own code, from the user's own files and from public documentation (section
19); working notes kept outside the repository are not part of the project.

**Release baseline (P0) is done.** `v0.1.0` (= `c147306`) is pushed, and the GitHub Release
"ElectronDB v0.1.0 — primera versión estable" (published under the earlier name) is marked
Latest. Nothing from this branch is tagged or released as Latest until it is meant to replace the
current release (section 16, P0).

## 0. Scope and invariants

**Goal (decided by the user).** Add PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite and MongoDB at "daily use" level:

- connect, including over SSH
- explore objects
- view and edit data
- query editor with autocomplete
- editable results
- table designer (for MongoDB: a collection designer)

Import Navicat connections of every type. **No `.nb3` backups and no automation for the new
engines in this version.**

**Invariants that every phase must keep:**

1. **MySQL behaves identically.** Same SQL text, same IPC results, same production-guard
   decisions and dialog reasons, same backups, jobs and Navicat import. P1a is a refactor with
   zero behaviour change, proven by the existing unit and integration suites passing unchanged
   apart from import paths, **with the integration suites actually running** (section 15.3). The
   only MySQL-visible changes in this whole plan are listed by name in section 20 ("MySQL-visible
   changes"); each one is additive and called out in release notes.
2. **The IPC map in `src/shared/ipc.ts` stays the only renderer↔main API**, and changes to it are
   additive. Existing channels keep their argument order. They are only _widened_: a string
   argument becomes "string or object", and the string keeps today's meaning.
3. **No native modules.** `electron-builder.yml` keeps `npmRebuild: false`, and mac, win and linux
   builds still come from one Mac.
4. **Production guard.** Every write to an `environment === 'production'` connection, on any
   engine, needs `confirmProduction` or the UI dialog. Main enforces it with an engine-aware
   **denylist** (`isObviousWrite`); the renderer asks using an engine-aware **allowlist with
   reasons** (`analyzeWrites`). Main must never flag what the renderer lets through (section 10).
5. **No query data, passwords, document contents or foreign file paths in logs.** PostgreSQL
   `detail`, MongoDB `keyValue`/`errInfo`, and any server message that echoes values are shown to
   the user but logged only as class name and code (section 5.7).
6. **Spanish UI, English code.** Errors thrown from IPC handlers are actionable Spanish messages.
7. **Only credentials the user gave Vortaq.** No driver may fall back to environment
   variables, `~/.pgpass`, OS user names or other ambient credentials (section 5.6, PostgreSQL).
8. **Opening never creates.** Connecting, testing or importing never creates a file. A SQLite
   file is created only from "Nuevo archivo SQLite…" (section 5.6, SQLite).
9. **The stable release stays stable.** `main` must stay releasable. Engines that are not finished
   are hidden behind a preview flag (section 3), and every build made from multi-engine work is
   published as a GitHub **prerelease** until the user decides it replaces v0.1.0 as Latest.

**Non-goals for this version:**

- Backups or automation for engines other than `mysql`.
- User and role management for PostgreSQL and MongoDB (read-only lists at most, later).
- Encrypted SQLite files (SQLCipher / SQLite3MultipleCiphers).
- MongoDB GSSAPI/Kerberos, AWS IAM and OIDC sign-in.
- MongoDB replica sets or SRV over SSH (needs a SOCKS bridge, later).
- Navicat HTTP tunnels.
- Importing from the live Windows registry.
- PostgreSQL-compatible servers with a different catalog: Redshift, GaussDB/openGauss and
  KingbaseES (imported as unsupported, section 12.1). MongoDB on DocumentDB and Cosmos DB is
  supported only with `retryWrites=false` (set automatically).
- PostgreSQL multi-host failover (`hostportlist`): only the first host is used, with a warning.

**Named for later (not v1), so they are not lost:** PostgreSQL visual EXPLAIN and MongoDB
explain view; read-only role lists for PostgreSQL and MongoDB; "Ejecutar función…" with an
argument prompt; a visual MongoDB Find builder; GridFS grouping; data export (CSV/JSON) and "Copiar
como INSERT" per engine; `LISTEN/NOTIFY` output and `\copy`; a second read-only SQLite process for
introspection; MySQL per-tab sessions and `KILL QUERY` cancel (section 5.3.1); read-only DDL for PG
rules and RLS policies; SQLite recent files and drag-and-drop; tree group counts.

}
```

Rules:

- **Host fields.** `host`, `port` and `username` stay required in the type, so MySQL code is
  untouched. For SQLite they are `''`, `0` and `''`. For a MongoDB SRV connection, `port` is `0`.
- **Normalisation in `ConnectionsRepo`** (`storage/repos.ts:20-58`). On read and on save it sets
  `engine ??= 'mysql'` and fills the defaults of the engine's block. The JSON file is never
  rewritten just to add the field.
- **Engine immutability lives in `ConnectionsRepo.save`**, not in the IPC handler, because the
  Navicat importer writes through the repo directly (`navicat/importer.ts:176-179`) and rebuilds
  records from scratch (`toConnectionInput`, `importer.ts:55-79`). Saving an existing `id` with a
  different `engine` throws "No se puede cambiar el motor de una conexión existente; crea una
  conexión nueva." An input without `engine` keeps the stored one.
- **`network`.** Used by PG and MongoDB from their first phase. MySQL ignores it in v1, so MySQL
  connect behaviour is unchanged.
- **Endpoint signature** (`ipc/connections.ts:7-9`, which decides whether an open connection must
  reconnect) includes `engine` and the engine block.
- **Validation** moves to a pure `src/shared/connectionValidation.ts` used by both
  `ipc/connections.ts:11-18` and the renderer's `connectionForm.ts:58-71`. For example: SQLite
  requires an absolute `filePath` for the current platform; MongoDB with SRV needs no port and
  implies TLS; MongoDB with SSH must be standalone (or use `directConnection`) and must not use
  SRV; `mongo.extraOptions` must not contain credential keys.
- **Downgrade.** An older build (v0.1.x) would treat a PostgreSQL record as MySQL and fail to
  connect with a confusing error. That is acceptable for a private app, but the release notes for
  the first multi-engine version must say so.

### 2.1 Neutral metadata (replaces string matching in the renderer)

The renderer matches MySQL strings today: `'PRIMARY'`, `'PRI'`, `/auto_increment/`,
`'BASE TABLE'` and `' unsigned'` (coupling §1.4). Every driver must fill these new fields:

```ts
export type TypeKind =
  | 'integer'
  | 'decimal'
  | 'float'
  | 'boolean'
  | 'text'
  | 'binary'
  | 'date'
  | 'time'
  | 'datetime'
  | 'json'
  | 'uuid'
  | 'enum'
  | 'array'
  | 'spatial'
  | 'other'

ColumnInfo  += primaryKey: boolean; autoIncrement: boolean   // AUTO_INCREMENT / identity / serial / INTEGER PK AUTOINCREMENT
               generated: 'virtual' | 'stored' | null; typeKind: TypeKind; hidden?: boolean // MariaDB INVISIBLE
               hasDefault: boolean                           // omit from INSERT when the cell is untouched
               identity: 'always' | 'by-default' | null      // PG; 'always' => read-only on insert
               enumValues?: string[]                         // PG pg_enum (enumsortorder); MySQL parsed from the type
               sqlType?: string                              // PG format_type(atttypid, atttypmod), for typed binds
IndexInfo   += primary: boolean
TableStructure += kind: 'table' | 'view' | 'system-versioned' | 'partitioned' | 'materialized-view' | 'foreign'
                  database?: string                          // PG
QueryColumn += typeKind?: TypeKind; database?: string; readOnlyReason?: string
QueryStatementResult / TableDataResult
            += storage?: ('null' | 'integer' | 'real' | 'text' | 'blob')[][] // SQLite only: per-cell storage class
ServerInfo  += engine?: EngineId; details?: { label: string; value: string }[]
               runtime?: { flavor: string; versionNumber: number; transactions: boolean;
                           returning: 'none' | 'insert-delete' | 'all'; topology?: MongoTopology }
ApplyRowChangesResult.insertIds: (number | string | null)[]   // uuid, ObjectId, RETURNING values
```

`ServerInfo`'s existing MySQL fields stay required. Other engines fill neutral values and
`InfoPanel.vue` renders `details` when it is present.

### 2.2 Value-fidelity contract (one rule for all drivers)

`CellValue = string | number | boolean | null` stays as it is. Every driver normalises:

- **Temporal, decimal, 64-bit and JSON values** arrive as the server's text. Nothing is ever
  turned into a JS `Date`.
- **Binary** values become `0xHEX`.
- **MongoDB** values travel as canonical EJSON text.

Per engine:

| Engine        | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MySQL/MariaDB | Today's pool options (`dateStrings`, `bigNumberStrings`, `jsonStrings`), unchanged. The MariaDB `extendedFormat: 'json'` stays raw with `jsonStrings: true` (verified).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| PostgreSQL    | A per-client `types` override parses only bool, int2, int4, oid, float4 and float8. Every other OID returns the raw server text. `bytea` `\x..` becomes `0x..`. Verified in `pg2.mjs`. **The text form depends on session settings, so every PG session pins them** (below). Writes bind as `$n::<sqlType>` so enums, domains and arrays cast explicitly. After a save the row is replaced by its `RETURNING *` result (jsonb reorders keys). |
| SQLite        | `setReadBigInts(true)`. A `bigint` becomes a number when it is safe, otherwise a string. `Uint8Array` becomes `0xHEX`. Each cell keeps its **storage class** (`storage`), and edits keep it: the declared type never rejects or coerces a value (dynamic typing; STRICT tables report their own errors).                                                                                                                                      |
| MongoDB       | `EJSON.stringify(doc, { relaxed: false })`. Relaxed EJSON rounds Int64 (verified: `…993` became `…992`). Inline edits keep the cell's BSON type (section 9.2).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Pinned PostgreSQL session settings** (set on every new PG connection, pooled or tab):
`DateStyle='ISO, MDY'`, `IntervalStyle='postgres'`, `extra_float_digits=3`, `bytea_output='hex'`,
`client_encoding='UTF8'`, `application_name='Vortaq'`, and `TimeZone` from
`postgres.timeZone` when set. The effective time zone is shown in the status bar.

**Large values (new engines only; MySQL unchanged).** Binary and text cells over 64 KB are sent
truncated and marked read-only, with a "Ver valor completo" action that fetches the full value
by row identity into a new value viewer. There is no blob viewer today.

**Groups:**

- mysql: `tables, views, functions, events, queries, backups`
- mariadb: `tables, views, functions, events, sequences, queries`
- postgresql: `tables, views, materializedViews, functions, sequences, types, queries`, plus an
  `extensions` group at the **database** level (read-only list from `pg_extension`)
- sqlite: `tables, views, indexes, triggers, queries`
- mongodb: `collections, views, queries`

PG `types` lists enums, domains and composite types (`pg_type` with `typtype IN ('e','d','c')`,
excluding table row types). PG tables list excludes partitions (`relispartition`); partitions
are nested, collapsed, under their parent. Foreign tables (`relkind 'f'`) are listed under
`tables` with a badge. MongoDB hides `system.*`; `*.chunks` GridFS collections are read-only.

The groups come from coupling §11, drivers §2.6, §3.2, §4.3 and §5.2, and the daily-use review.

**Preview flag (D14).** An engine with `preview: true` is hidden in the "Nueva conexión" picker
and in Navicat import unless "Motores en vista previa" is switched on in `SettingsDialog.vue`. Existing
connections of a preview engine still open. Each phase flips its engine to `preview: false` in its
"done when". Independently of the flag, every build made from multi-engine work is published as a
GitHub prerelease until the user decides to promote one to Latest (invariant 9).

**Runtime overrides** come from `connections:open`'s `ServerInfo.runtime`:

- MongoDB `transactions` is false on a standalone server (verified).
- MariaDB `returning` depends on the version (RETURNING exists from 10.5 for INSERT and 10.0 for
  DELETE).
- PostgreSQL catalog queries are gated on `server_version_num`.

The renderer combines the static flags with `runtime` in a `useEngine(connectionId)` composable.

## 4. Object hierarchy and addressing

Today, every object channel takes `(connectionId, schema, ...)`, and "schema" means "the namespace
that holds objects". That stays. Only PostgreSQL needs a second qualifier.

```ts
/** A plain string keeps today's meaning; PG uses the object form. */
export type SchemaRef = string | { database: string; schema: string }

/** For objects whose name alone is not unique or not enough to drop them. */
export interface ObjectRef {
  type: ObjectType
  name: string
  /** PG routines: identity args from pg_get_function_identity_arguments (overloads). */
  signature?: string
  /** PG/SQLite triggers and indexes: owning table (DROP TRIGGER t ON tbl). */
  table?: string
}
export type NameRef = string | ObjectRef

export type ObjectType =
  | 'table'
  | 'view'
  | 'function'
  | 'procedure'
  | 'event'
  | 'trigger' // today
  | 'materialized_view'
  | 'sequence'
  | 'collection'
  | 'index'
  | 'type' // new
```

| Engine          | String `schema` means                                               | Object form                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| mysql / mariadb | database (today)                                                    | not used                             |
| postgresql      | **rejected by main** ("Falta la base de datos: actualiza la vista") | **required**: `{ database, schema }` |
| sqlite          | attached database alias: `main`, `temp` or an ATTACHed alias        | not used                             |
| mongodb         | database (only for shared channels such as `db:databases`)          | not used                             |

For `hierarchy === 'database>schema'`, main rejects a plain string `SchemaRef` on every channel.
A string shorthand that meant "schema in the initial database" would let any renderer path that
still sends `node.schema` drop or truncate in the wrong database (`useObjectActions.ts:68`
dropObject, `:76-86` TRUNCATE, which always sends `confirmProduction: true`).

### 4.1 Tree and tabs (renderer)

- **`stores/tree.ts:18-48`.**
  - Add a `'database'` node kind, used only when `capabilities.hierarchy === 'database>schema'`.
  - Groups under a namespace come from `descriptor.groups` filtered by capabilities, replacing the
    global `GROUPS`.
  - Change node ids from `:`-joined strings to an escaped path encoding:
    `encodeURIComponent` per segment, or a JSON array. A schema or table name that contains `:`
    already mis-parses today (`tree.ts:74-108`).
  - Tree caches (`groupKey` at `tree.ts:50`, `databases`, and schema lists) are keyed by
    `(connectionId, database)` on PG, not by connection only.
  - PG databases with `datallowconn = false` or `datistemplate` are hidden unless
    `showSystemSchemas`. A PG database node is **closed** (grey) until the user expands it, which
    opens its pool; its menu has "Cerrar base de datos". Pools are closed by idle LRU only, and
    reaching the cap of 8 gives "Demasiadas bases de datos abiertas: cierra alguna".
  - The tree filter (`tree.ts:298`, label substring today) also matches `schema.table` and
    `db.collection` on engines with an extra level.
- **`stores/tabs.ts`.** `WorkspaceTab`/`OpenTabInput` gain `database?: string`, plus the widened
  `ObjectType`. Query tab ids such as `query:${cid}:${id}` stay. **Object tab ids include the
  database** on PG: `tableData:${cid}:${db}:${schema}:${table}` and the designer equivalent
  (`useWorkspace.ts:53` today has no database, so `public.users` in two databases would reuse one
  tab via the dedupe at `tabs.ts:78-81`). MySQL ids are unchanged. Tab titles become
  `object@db.schema (conn)` on PG (`tabs.ts:155`); persisted tabs store `database`.
- **Saved queries** (`utils/savedQueries.ts:1-7`, `stores/queries.ts:26-31`) gain
  `database?: string`, also in the tree's "queries" group key. A missing value means the
  connection's initial database. MySQL records are unchanged.
- **Remembered schema.** The last schema used per PG database is kept per viewer and expanded on
  open (the connection has no "initial schema" field).
- **`useObjectActions.ts`.** `objectTypeOf`, `newObjectFor` and `actionsFor` become
  descriptor-driven. For example, MongoDB shows "Nueva colección" and no "Nueva tabla", and
  backup entries appear only when `supportsBackupsNb3`. Minimum daily menus per engine (writes
  go through the production guard):

## 5. Main process: drivers

### 5.1 Layout

```
src/main/db/                 generic, engine-agnostic
  driver.ts                  Driver / DriverConnection / SqlSession / DocumentConnection interfaces
  registry.ts                getDriver(engine): Driver   (lazy imports so unused drivers never load)
  manager.ts                 ConnectionManager: open dedupe, secrets, tunnel, fatal → event:connectionClosed, closeAll
  errors.ts                  DbUserError (MysqlUserError extends it), describeForUser / describeForLog
  tunnel.ts                  moved from mysql/tunnel.ts (already generic: targetHost/targetPort → local port)
  query.ts                   executeScript(session, dialect, script, opts): split → run → normalise
  tableData.ts               fetchTableData via dialect.selectPage + driver.countRows + primary key
  rowChanges.ts              generic INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE builder over dialect (+ RETURNING)
src/main/mysql/              mysql + mariadb driver (existing code; driver.ts adapter added)
src/main/postgres/           pg driver

**Backup and automation** keep receiving a `SessionFactory` that returns today's `MysqlSession`
(`mysql/types.ts:9-31`). `getSessionFactory(ctx)` is implemented by the generic manager. It throws
`DbUserError("Las copias de seguridad y la automatización solo están disponibles para conexiones
MySQL.")` when the connection's engine lacks `supportsBackupsNb3`.

### 5.3 Generic `ConnectionManager` (`src/main/db/manager.ts`)

The engine-agnostic parts of `mysql/manager.ts` move here unchanged:

- open dedupe (`:210-218`)
- tunnel resolution (`:260-274`)
- fatal handling (`:324-331`)
- `closeAll` (`:166-168`)

For each `open(id)` the manager:

1. Loads the config, normalising `engine`.
2. Reads secrets through `CredentialStore`. The password is optional when
   `capabilities.passwordOptional` is set.
3. If `ssh.enabled` and `supportsSsh`, opens one SSH tunnel per connection and passes
   `{host: '127.0.0.1', port: local, tlsServername: realHost}`. PG and MongoDB need the real host
   for TLS SNI and verification through a tunnel (drivers §2.1, §5.1).
4. Calls `getDriver(engine).open(...)` and stores the `DriverConnection`.
5. Emits `event:connectionClosed` on fatal errors, as today.

PostgreSQL keeps **one pool per database**, all of them through the same tunnel endpoint. Pools
other than the initial database are created when the user opens that database in the tree and
closed after 10 minutes idle (LRU over idle pools only). At most 8 database pools are open per
connection. Pooled PG sessions run `DISCARD ALL` and re-apply the pinned settings on release, or
are destroyed when dirty (open or failed transaction).

`closeAll` and fatal handlers never pass raw driver errors to `log.x(msg, err)`
(`index.ts:88`, `headless.ts:35` serialise the full `stack`); they log `describeForLog(err)`.

#### 5.3.1 Query-tab sessions (D12)

Today every `db:execute` takes a short-lived pooled session (`ipc/db.ts:62-67`) and a dirty one is
destroyed on release (`mysql/session.ts:40-45`), so `BEGIN` in one run and `COMMIT` in the next
never meet. Users of PostgreSQL expect one connection per query window. For engines with `tabSessions`:

- `QueryExecuteOptions` gains `sessionKey?: string` (the query tab id). With it, main runs the
  script on the tab's `TabSession`, opening it on first use. Without it (or on MySQL), today's
  per-run behaviour applies.
- New channels `db:sessionState`, `db:commit`, `db:rollback` and `db:closeSession` (section 7.2).
  Closing a tab calls `db:closeSession`; when the transaction is `in` or `failed`, the renderer
  first asks "Confirmar / Deshacer / Cancelar".
- Every statement result carries `transactionStatus`. The status bar shows it next to
  Commit/Rollback buttons; `failed` shows "Transacción abortada: ejecuta ROLLBACK".
- Idle timeout: a tab session idle for 30 minutes **without** an open transaction is closed and
  silently reopened on the next run. One with an open transaction is never closed by timeout;
  keepalive (`network.keepAliveSec`) keeps it up, and if the server drops it the tab shows
  "Conexión perdida: la transacción abierta se ha deshecho".
- **PostgreSQL search_path rule.** On open and on every schema change from the tab's combo, read
  the server default once (`current_setting('search_path')` on a fresh session) and set
  `"<schema>", <default list>` without duplicates, so `public` (where `uuid-ossp`, `pgcrypto`,
  `postgis` and `citext` usually live) stays visible. After each run, read `current_schema()` back
  and update the combo, so `SET search_path TO x` in SQL is reflected. Changing the tab's
  **database** closes the tab session (asking first when a transaction is open) and opens one on
  the new database's pool endpoint.
- **SQLite.** One utility process per connection means one handle: all tabs, the grid and
  introspection share one transaction. The tab session is therefore logical: results expose
  `DatabaseSync.isTransaction` and the owning tab. While a tab owns an open transaction, grid
  saves and other tabs' writes are refused with "Hay una transacción abierta en otra pestaña";
  reads still run.
- **MongoDB.** A tab session is a `ClientSession` used for `use <db>` state and, on replica sets,
  explicit transactions started from the editor toolbar. Standalone servers show no transaction
  controls.
- **Cancel** binds to an execution that is still running on a dedicated session: the generic
  layer records `{executionId → session, server pid/thread}` while the statement runs and drops
  it before the session can be reused, so a late cancel can never hit another statement. The
  `KILL QUERY` cancel for MySQL ships only together with MySQL tab sessions (later, see non-goals),
  never as part of a PG phase.

### 5.4 Result-source metadata (editable results)

Every driver fills `QueryColumn.{schema, table, sourceName, primaryKey, tableAlias?, typeKind,
readOnlyReason?}`.

Capped, time-series, view and GridFS `*.chunks` collections carry a `readOnlyReason`. |

`resultEditability.ts` stops reading `name === 'PRIMARY'` and `tableType === 'BASE TABLE'`. It
uses `IndexInfo.primary` and `TableStructure.kind`, and skips the alias-equality check when
`!resultAliasMetadata`.

**Inserts on every SQL engine** (`db/rowChanges.ts`): a cell the user never touched in a column
with `hasDefault` or `identity` is **omitted** from the INSERT; a cell explicitly set to NULL sends
NULL; `identity: 'always'` and generated columns are read-only. Where `returning` allows it, the
saved row is replaced by its `RETURNING *` result; otherwise it is re-read by identity. MySQL keeps
today's builder (it already relies on `insertId`), so MySQL SQL text is unchanged.

### 5.5 Query execution and streaming

- The generic `executeScript` keeps today's loop (`mysql/query.ts:48-79`) and takes the splitter
  from the dialect.
- **PostgreSQL.** Each split statement runs through `pg-cursor` with
  `read(maxRows + 1, cb)` and then `close()`. This gives an exact row cap and works for DML, DDL
  and `RETURNING` (verified). Multiple statements are never sent in one call: the extended
  protocol rejects them, and the simple protocol has no row cap.
- **PostgreSQL transaction state.** After an error inside `BEGIN`, PG answers `25P02` to every
  later statement until a rollback. The "dirty ⇒ destroy" rule (`client.release(true)`, as in
  `session.ts`) applies **only to pooled internal sessions**. A tab session keeps its open or
  failed transaction for the user to finish (section 5.3.1). The statement result reports
  `transactionStatus` (`idle` / `in` / `failed`).
- **SQLite.** Each statement uses `prepare()`, then `iterate()`, and stops after `maxRows + 1`
  rows. The script **must** be split first: `prepare("SELECT 1; DELETE FROM b")` silently drops
  the DELETE (verified).
- **MongoDB.** See section 8.4.
- **Cancel (new).** `QueryExecuteOptions.executionId` is added, along with `db:cancel`. Cancel
  targets only an execution still registered as running (section 5.3.1).
  - PostgreSQL: `pg_cancel_backend(pid)` from a pooled session, giving error `57014`.
  - SQLite: kill the utility process and reopen it. The message says what was lost: "Consulta
    cancelada; la conexión se ha reabierto y se han perdido las tablas temporales, los ATTACH de
    sesión y la transacción abierta". On reopen the configured attachments and `initialQueries`
    are re-applied.
  - MongoDB: `killOp` on the operation tagged with `comment: executionId`.
  - MySQL: not in this plan's phases (needs MySQL tab sessions first; see non-goals).

### 5.6 Per-engine driver notes

**MySQL / MariaDB (`src/main/mysql/`)**

- `driver.ts` adapts the existing `ConnectionManager`, `PooledSession`, `introspect` and `values`
  code to the interfaces above. **No SQL text changes for MySQL.**
- Flavour detection: `/mariadb/i` on `VERSION()`, after stripping a `5.5.5-` prefix. The result
  goes to `ServerInfo.runtime.flavor`.
- MariaDB correctness fixes, keyed on the detected flavour (drivers §3.2, all verified on 11.8.9):
  - `listTables` includes `TABLE_TYPE IN ('BASE TABLE','SYSTEM VERSIONED')`. Sequences are listed
    separately.
  - `COLUMN_DEFAULT` is unquoted. The string `'NULL'` means NULL, and string literals come back
    quoted.
  - Users come from `mysql.global_priv` via `JSON_VALUE` (or `SHOW CREATE USER`).
    `mysql.user.account_locked` does not exist on MariaDB.
  - The count timeout uses `SET STATEMENT max_statement_time=3 FOR SELECT ...` instead of the
    ignored `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` hint.
  - Labels come from `extendedTypeName` (`uuid`, `inet6`, `inet4`, `vector`) and
    `extendedFormat === 'json'`.
  - INVISIBLE columns are selected explicitly in the table data view.
- MariaDB authentication: an `authPlugins` map for `client_ed25519` and `parsec`, about 40 lines
  plus `@noble/curves` (MIT, pure JS). Both were verified, including rejection of a wrong
  password. The parsec iteration factor is capped at 8. **`@noble/curves` and `@noble/hashes` 2.4
  are ESM-only** and were only loaded from a `.mjs` probe; the main bundle is CommonJS
  (`electron.vite.config.ts:9`). Before shipping, load them from the built `out/main` of a
  packaged app; if `require(esm)` fails, bundle them inline as is done for `plist`. Ships with the
  MariaDB engine phase (P5), pending user confirmation (open question 4).
- **Backups on a MariaDB server** (D4). `backup/create.ts:148-153` keeps only `BASE TABLE` and
  `VIEW`, so system-versioned tables and sequences are silently left out of the `.nb3`. P1b adds a
  pre-backup check, only when `runtime.flavor === 'mariadb'`: if the schema has such objects, the
  backup dialog warns "La copia no incluye N tablas versionadas / secuencias: …" (names only) and
  the job log records the same warning. The `.nb3` format and MySQL-server backups are unchanged.

**PostgreSQL (`src/main/postgres/`)**

- `pg` with config objects, never connection strings. Connection strings with `sslmode` trigger
  the pg 9 SECURITY WARNING and treat `require` as `verify-full`.
- **No ambient credentials (invariant 7).** pg's `connection-parameters.js` uses
  `if (config[key])`, so an empty or null `password` falls back to `PGPASSWORD` and then
  `~/.pgpass` (`client.js:296-306`), and `user`/`database` fall back to `PGUSER`/`USER`/
  `PGDATABASE`. The driver therefore always passes `password: async () => secret ?? ''` (the
  function form skips env and pgpass), and always sets `user`, `database`, `host` and `port`
  explicitly. A unit test runs with `PGPASSWORD`, `PGUSER` and a temp `PGPASSFILE` set and asserts
  none of them is used.
- `connectionTimeoutMillis` and `keepAlive`/`keepAliveInitialDelayMillis` come from `network`.
- Every new client runs the pinned session settings (section 2.2) before first use.
- SSL mode mapping (drivers §2.1):
  - `disable` → `false`
  - `allow` → try without SSL; retry with `{rejectUnauthorized:false}` only when the server
    refuses a non-SSL connection (`28000` "no pg_hba.conf entry … no encryption")
  - `require` → `{rejectUnauthorized:false}`
  - `verify-ca` → `{ca, rejectUnauthorized:true, checkServerIdentity: () => undefined}`
  - `verify-full` → `{ca, rejectUnauthorized:true}`
  - `prefer` → try SSL, and retry without it only on "The server does not support SSL
    connections".
  - Through SSH, also set `servername: realHost`.
- Introspection uses **pg_catalog, not information_schema**, because information_schema hides
  materialized views. The queries are saved in the probe file `sql/pg-introspect.sql`, which
  becomes `src/main/postgres/catalog.ts`:
  - `relkind IN ('r','p','v','m','f')`, with partitions nested via `relispartition`
  - identity and generated columns from `attidentity`/`attgenerated`
  - overloads from `pg_get_function_identity_arguments`
  - `pg_get_viewdef`, `pg_get_functiondef` and `pg_get_triggerdef`
  - Use `json_agg` and `array_agg(x::text)` in catalog queries: `name[]` comes back as a literal
    string.
- `objectDdl('table')` builds the DDL: `CREATE TABLE` from columns plus `pg_get_constraintdef`,
  then `CREATE INDEX` (`pg_get_indexdef`, skipping indexes that back constraints), `COMMENT ON`,
  triggers, and `ALTER SEQUENCE … OWNED BY`. PG has no `SHOW CREATE TABLE`.
- The minimum supported server is **PG 12** (`attgenerated`, `prokind`). Older servers get
  best-effort support, with catalog columns gated on `server_version_num`.
- Catalog additions for daily use: enum labels (`pg_enum` by `enumsortorder`) into
  `ColumnInfo.enumValues`; domains resolve `typeKind` through `typbasetype`; sequences list
  `last_value` (`pg_sequences`) and `owned_by`; `ObjectSummary` for tables carries estimated rows
  (`reltuples`, `-1` shown as "—"), `pg_total_relation_size`, owner and comment; trigger functions
  (`prorettype = 'trigger'`) and procedures are marked in the functions list; the designer's type
  picker loads `pg_type` (base, enum, domain, composite, range, plus extension types) at runtime.
- Errors: `code` is the SQLSTATE. `position` (a 1-based offset) maps to an editor marker. `detail`
  is shown to the user but never logged. `0A000` "cross-database references" explains "Cambia la
  base de datos de la pestaña"; `22P02` on an array shows the literal format `{a,b,"c d"}`.

**SQLite (`src/main/sqlite/`)**

- `core.ts` holds pure `node:sqlite` logic with no Electron imports, so the vitest node project can
  test it. It covers open (`new DatabaseSync(path, {readOnly, enableForeignKeyConstraints:
foreignKeys, timeout})`), ATTACH, run with a row cap, introspection, and normalisation.
  - **Open never creates (invariant 8; verified: `new DatabaseSync(path)` creates a missing file,
    and `C:\Users\x\typo.db` became a literal file in the current directory on macOS).** Before
    opening, `core.ts` requires `path.isAbsolute(p)` for the current platform and `existsSync(p)`,
    and fails with "Archivo no encontrado: <nombre>" plus a "Buscar…" action. The same check runs
    for "Probar conexión" and for every configured attachment. A file is created only by "Nuevo
    archivo SQLite…" (`app:pickSaveFile`), which opens with create explicitly.
  - ATTACH binds the path as a parameter (`ATTACH DATABASE ? AS <dialect.quoteIdent(alias)>`).
  - The file opens read-only when `readOnly` is set or the file or its folder is not writable
    (WAL needs to write `-shm`), and the dialog says why. A production connection that is
    read-only has a "Reabrir en modo escritura" action, with confirmation; without it the
    production write confirmation could never succeed.
  - `foreignKeys` is a connection option (Avanzado, "Aplicar claves foráneas"): on for files
    created here, **off for opened or imported files**, so cascades and FK errors don't appear in
    other apps' files unless the user asks.
  - Introspection uses `sqlite_schema`, `PRAGMA table_list`, `pragma_table_xinfo`,
    `pragma_index_list`/`index_xinfo` and `pragma_foreign_key_list`.
  - Normalisation sets `setReadBigInts(true)` and `setReturnArrays(true)`.
- `worker.ts` is the `utilityProcess` entry. It wraps `core.ts` behind a `MessagePort` RPC
  (`{id, op, args}` → `{id, ok, result | error}`).
- `driver.ts` runs in main. It spawns **one utility process per open SQLite connection**, at most
  4 at a time ("Demasiados archivos SQLite abiertos: cierra alguno"), keeps a FIFO queue (single
  writer; introspection behind a long query shows "ocupado"), and implements cancel as `kill()`
  plus reopen (message in section 5.5). SQLite's journal rolls back any open transaction.
  - Why a process and not a worker thread: `worker.terminate()` waited 21.5 s for a running step,
    while `utilityProcess.kill()` returned in 12 ms (verified). node:sqlite has no
    `sqlite3_interrupt`.
- The spawner is injected (`ProcessSpawner`), so node-side tests use an in-process fake and never
  import `electron` (a CLAUDE.md rule).
- Row identity: **every rowid table is edited by rowid**, even when it has a PK (rowid-table PKs
  allow NULLs and type-affinity duplicates). The rowid is selected as a hidden `"__rowid"` column
  through the first unshadowed alias of `rowid`, `_rowid_`, `oid`; if all three are real
  columns, identity is `none`. `WITHOUT ROWID` tables use their PK.
- **Tree from `PRAGMA database_list`**: `main`, `temp` when it has objects, and every attachment.
  Attachments made from the editor are marked "temporal (esta sesión)", and the tree refreshes
  after any statement classified as ATTACH or DETACH.
- Generated columns (`pragma_table_xinfo.hidden` 2/3) are read-only in the grid.
- WAL: the error for a read-only WAL file in a read-only folder is mapped. The rebuild's
  optional "copiar el archivo antes" uses `VACUUM INTO`, which includes WAL content.
- No SSH, SSL, users or create-database. "Nueva base de datos" means "Nuevo archivo SQLite…" in the
  connection dialog.

**MongoDB (`src/main/mongo/`)**

- `client.ts` builds `MongoClientOptions` from `MongoOptions`. The rules:
  - `promoteLongs: false` and `bsonRegExp: true`.
  - **Credentials go in the `auth` option, never in the URI** given to `MongoClient`. A raw URI
    is never persisted, logged, or echoed in previews or warnings.
  - `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` and `connectTimeoutMS` from `network.connectTimeoutMs` (default
    10 s instead of the driver's 30 s); `retryWrites`/`retryReads` from `MongoOptions`;
    `appName: 'Vortaq'`; `extraOptions` passed through after the credential-key denylist.
  - SRV implies TLS.
  - With SSH: refuse SRV and multi-host with an actionable message, and force
    `directConnection: true`.
  - TLS goes through `servername`.
  - GSSAPI, AWS and OIDC are rejected with "Mecanismo de autenticación no soportado en esta
    versión".
  - zstd and snappy compression are never requested (zlib only).
- `introspect.ts` covers:
  - `listDatabases` with `authorizedDatabases: true`, falling back to `defaultDatabase` when the
    user lacks the privilege
  - `listCollections`, hiding `system.views` and `system.buckets.*`
  - `$collStats`, `estimatedDocumentCount` and `indexes()`
  - field inference by `$sample` (size 1000), which walks paths and records BSON type counts
- `documents.ts`, `changes.ts`, `shell/*` and `ejson.ts` are covered in section 8.
- Transactions only when `runtime.topology !== 'standalone'`. On standalone servers, grid saves
  apply one by one and report partial failure per row, as `rowChangeFailure.ts` does today.
- `connections:open` / "Probar conexión" report the member role via `hello`. A direct connection
  that lands on a secondary says "Conectado a un secundario: solo lectura" and sets
  `readPreference: 'secondaryPreferred'` for reads; writes map `NotWritablePrimary` to the same
  message.
- Results keep their cursor open server-side (10-minute idle timeout, at most 5 per tab) so the
  grid can "Cargar más" through `mongo:getMore`.

### 5.7 Errors

- `DbUserError` (in `src/main/db/errors.ts`) is the "safe to show **and** safe to log" class: its
  message is written by Vortaq and never contains server text. `MysqlUserError extends
DbUserError` keeps every existing `instanceof` working. `ipc/errorLog.ts:19` trusts `DbUserError`.
- **`ServerError extends Error`** (new) carries server-derived text that may echo values (Mongo
  `E11000 … dup key: { email: "…" }`, PG `22P02 … "value"`, shell-bson-parser messages that echo
  the filter). The renderer shows its message; `errorLog.ts` logs only `ServerError(<code>)`.
  Drivers never wrap server text in `DbUserError`. A unit test feeds a value-echoing error through
  the IPC error path and asserts the log line has no value.
- Each driver exports two functions:
  - `describeForUser(err)` returns the Spanish message plus the `(CODE)` suffix. The suffix
    contract that `privileges.ts` and `friendlyError` parse stays.
  - `describeForLog(err)` returns only the code and constraint or object name.
- Error explanations are maps keyed by code in the shared dialect (`dialect.explainError`):
  - PG SQLSTATE: 23502, 23505, 23503, 22001, 22003, 22P02, 42501, 40P01, 55P03, 57014, 25P02
  - SQLite `errcode`s: CONSTRAINT_*, READONLY, BUSY
  - MongoDB codes: 11000, 121, 13, 50 (MaxTimeMSExpired)
- `isConnectionLost` per driver:
  - PG: `57P01`/`57P02`/`57P03`/`08006`/`ECONNRESET`
  - MongoDB: `MongoNetworkError`
  - SQLite: worker exit

## 6. Shared SQL dialects (`src/shared/dialects/`)

Pure TypeScript with no Node or DOM APIs, imported by main (splitting, guard, row changes, table
data SQL) and by the renderer (editor, guard dialog, editability parse, designer quoting).

```ts
export interface LexRules {
  identQuotes: ('`' | '"' | '[')[] // mysql: ['`'] (+'"' if ANSI_QUOTES, ignored); pg: ['"']; sqlite: ['"','[','`']
  stringQuotes: ("'" | '"')[] // mysql: ["'", '"']; pg/sqlite: ["'"]
  backslashEscapes: boolean | 'E-prefix' // mysql true; pg only inside E'..'; sqlite false
  hashComment: boolean // mysql true; pg/sqlite false ('#' is an operator in PG)
  dashCommentNeedsSpace: boolean // mysql true
  nestedBlockComments: boolean // pg true
  executableComments: ('/*!' | '/*M!' | '/*+')[] // mysql ['/*!','/*+'], mariadb + '/*M!'
  dollarQuotes: boolean // pg $tag$...$tag$
  delimiterCommand: boolean // mysql/mariadb DELIMITER
  blockBodies: 'none' | 'trigger-begin-end' // sqlite CREATE TRIGGER ... BEGIN ...; END
}

export interface SqlDialect {
  id: 'mysql' | 'mariadb' | 'postgresql' | 'sqlite'
  lex: LexRules
  tokenize(sql: string): Token[] // one lexer used by every consumer below
  splitStatements(script: string): string[]
  quoteIdent(name: string): string // pg: quote unless /^[a-z_][a-z0-9_$]*$/ and not reserved
  quoteString(value: string): string // pg/sqlite: '' doubling only
  qualified(schema: string | null, name: string): string
  placeholder(i: number): string // '?' or '$n'
  literal(value: CellValue, kind?: TypeKind): string // bool TRUE/FALSE for pg, 1/0 for mysql
  identCaseSensitive: 'quoted-only' | 'insensitive' | 'server' // pg folds unquoted to lower
  systemSchemas: string[]
  /** Main: small denylist; true only for statements that surely write (section 10). */
  isObviousWrite(statement: string): boolean
  /** Renderer: allowlist; anything not provably read-only is a write, with Spanish reasons. */
  analyzeWrites(script: string): { writes: boolean; reasons: string[] }
  selectPage(req: {
    table: string
    schema: string | null
    where: string | null
    orderBy: { column: string; direction: 'ASC' | 'DESC' } | null
    limit: number
    offset: number
    extraColumns?: string[]
  }): { sql: string; params: unknown[] }
  explainError(code: string): string | null
  isPrivilegeError(code: string): boolean
  keywords: { tableKeywords: string[]; modifiers: string[]; notAlias: string[] } // completion
  formatterLanguage: 'mysql' | 'mariadb' | 'postgresql' | 'sqlite' // sql-formatter 15
}
```

- `mysql.ts` **wraps** today's code with identical outputs. Each function keeps its own
  tokeniser, because they differ on purpose in edge cases (`sqlSplit.ts` handles DELIMITER,
  `writeGuard.normalize` unwraps `/*!`, `leadingKeyword` treats `/*!` as code):
  - `splitStatements` = `main/mysql/sqlSplit.ts` (MySQL CLI rules, DELIMITER)
  - `isObviousWrite` = `shared/productionGuard.ts:39-82`
  - `analyzeWrites` = renderer `query/writeGuard.ts:62-96` (with its reasons)
  - quoting = renderer `utils/sql.ts:1-50`
  - `query/selectSource.ts` and `editor/sqlCompletion.ts` keep their lexers for MySQL

  The functions are moved (not rewritten) and re-exported from their old paths for one phase. The
  old test files move along and must pass byte-for-byte. Only `tokenize` and `lex` are new, and
  MySQL consumers do not use them in v1.

- `mariadb.ts` is `mysql` plus the `/*M!` executable comments, `RETURNING`, and its own write
  keywords and type list.
- New dialects use **one lexer for every consumer** (split, guard, editability, completion).
- `postgresql.ts` lexes `$tag$` bodies, `E''`, nested `/* */`, `--` without a space, `::` casts,
  and `?`/`?|`/`#>>` jsonb operators. Placeholders are `$n`, and paging is
  `LIMIT n OFFSET m` (never `LIMIT m, n`).
- `sqlite.ts` keeps `CREATE TRIGGER … BEGIN …; END;` as one statement, and accepts `[ident]` and
  backtick identifiers.
- MongoDB has no `SqlDialect`. `src/shared/mongo/classify.ts` and `shellFormat.ts` play that role
  (section 8).

## 7. IPC contract changes (additive)

### 7.1 Widened (old calls compile and behave the same)

| `navicat:previewConnections`                                      | `NavicatConnectionPreview` gains `engine: EngineId \| null` (null = unsupported type or service provider), `navicatType`, `unsupportedReason?`, `hasPassword` and `warnings: string[]`. Warnings are returned to the renderer and **not logged** (they contain foreign paths and connection names); the log gets only counts. |
| `navicat:import`                                                  | `NavicatImportRequest` gains `connectionKeys?: {navicatType: string; name: string}[]`. Plain `connections: string[]` still means MySQL-section names.                                                                                                                                                                         |

MongoDB reuses `db:databases`, `db:createDatabase` (name plus first collection in
`engineOptions`), `db:dropDatabase` and `db:dropObject` (type `collection`/`view`).
`IPC_INVOKE_CHANNELS` and `ipc.test.ts` are updated in the same change as each channel.

```ts
export interface DocumentQuery {
  database: string
  collection: string
  filter: string // shell syntax, parsed in main
  sort: string
  projection: string
  skip: number
  limit: number
  executionId?: string
}
export interface DocumentPage {
  docs: string[] // canonical EJSON, one per document
  whole: boolean[] // per document: no projection, no inclusion $project, not size-truncated
  fields: FieldStat[] // top-level (and dotted) paths with BSON type counts
  total: number | null
  totalExact: boolean // estimatedDocumentCount vs countDocuments({maxTimeMS})
  truncated: boolean
  resultId: string | null // open cursor for mongo:getMore; null when exhausted
}
export type DocumentChange =
  | { kind: 'insert'; doc: string } // shell syntax or canonical EJSON
  | {
      kind: 'update'
      id: string // canonical EJSON of _id
      set: Record<string, string> // path → canonical EJSON (typed by the cell editor)
      unset: string[] // never an array element path: arrays are always $set whole
      expected: Record<string, string> // original value of each edited path (optimistic check)
    }
  | { kind: 'replace'; id: string; doc: string; fetchedWhole: true } // refused unless fetched whole
  | { kind: 'delete'; id: string }
```

## 8. Renderer

### 8.1 Engine UI registry (`src/renderer/src/engines/`)

```ts
export interface EngineUi {
  id: EngineId
  descriptor: EngineDescriptor
  dialect: SqlDialect | null // shared module; null for Mongo
  editorExtensions(): Extension[] // CodeMirror language + completion
  completionSource(provider: SchemaProvider): CompletionSource
  format?(text: string): string // sql-formatter language from dialect
  designer: DdlPlanner | null // SQL family; Mongo uses CollectionDesignerView
  typeCatalog: TypeCatalog | null // types, lengths, numeric rules (columnType.ts per engine)
  ddlTemplates: Partial<Record<ObjectType, (n: { schema: string; name: string }) => string>>
  newTableDraft(): TableDraft
  userSql: UserSqlBuilder | null // mysql/mariadb only in v1
  connectionSection: Component // General-tab body of ConnectionDialog
  objectColumns: Partial<Record<GroupKind, ObjectColumn[]>> // objectColumns.ts per engine
}
export function engineUi(engine: EngineId): EngineUi
export function useEngine(
  connectionId: Ref<string>
): ComputedRef<EngineUi & { runtime: ServerInfo['runtime'] }>
```

- `engines/mysql.ts` wraps today's modules unchanged (`utils/tableDesigner.ts`,
  `designer/alterTable.ts`, `designer/columnType.ts`, `designer/ddl.ts`, `data/userSql.ts`).
  P1a adds the indirection only.
- **CodeMirror.** `SqlEditor.vue` takes the language from `engineUi(...)`. The dialects come from
  `@codemirror/lang-sql` 6.10, which already ships `MySQL`, `MariaSQL`, `PostgreSQL` and `SQLite`:
  - mysql: `vortaqMySQL` (today)
  - mariadb: `MariaSQL` with `backslashEscapes`
  - postgresql: `PostgreSQL` (handles `$$` and `E''`)
  - sqlite: `SQLite`

  MongoDB uses `@codemirror/lang-javascript` (new dependency) with its own completion source
  (section 9.3).

- **Completion** (`sqlCompletion.ts`). The tokenizer takes `dialect.lex`. Keyword sets come from
  `dialect.keywords`. `quoteIfNeeded` uses `dialect.quoteIdent`. `cursorPath` treats the first
  qualifier as a _schema_ for PG and as an attached database for SQLite. The `SchemaProvider` in
  `QueryView.vue:49-76` is engine-aware: PG lists schemas of the tab's database. Completion
  inserts `"MyTable"` / `"user"` quoted when needed and matches unquoted input case-insensitively
  against folded names.
- **Query toolbar.** Today it has one "schema" combo filled from `db:databases`
  (`QueryView.vue:43-44, 177-182, 428-438`). PG gets **two combos, database and schema**; changing
  the database switches the tab session, changing the schema applies the search_path rule
  (section 5.3.1), and both follow `effectiveSchema` after each run. Engines with `tabSessions`
  show the transaction state with Commit/Rollback buttons, and the session time zone (PG).
- **Table designer.** One contract per engine:

  ```ts
  export interface DdlPlanner {
    buildCreate(draft: TableDraft): DdlPlan
    buildAlter(original: TableStructure, draft: TableDraft): DdlPlan
  }
  export interface DdlPlan {
    statements: string[]
    risks: DesignerRisk[] // computed from the draft diff, not by regex on SQL
    problems: string[]
    transactional: boolean // PG/SQLite: wrapped in BEGIN/COMMIT when applied
    rebuild?: { reason: string } // SQLite 12-step rebuild
  }
  ```

  - **MySQL/MariaDB:** today's `buildDesignerAlter`. MariaDB hides functional key parts, reads the
    default collation from the server instead of the literal `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` (absent before
    MariaDB 11.4), and handles quoted defaults (driver-unquoted).
  - **PostgreSQL:**
    - `ALTER COLUMN … TYPE … USING`, `SET/DROP NOT NULL`, `SET/DROP DEFAULT` and
      `RENAME COLUMN`
    - indexes as separate `CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX … USING <am>`
    - `COMMENT ON` statements
    - identity (`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY`) as the "auto increment" toggle for new
      columns. Existing `serial` columns show their `nextval('…'::regclass)` default and are
      recognised as "auto increment (serial)"; the designer never converts serial to identity
      silently.
    - **column reordering disabled for existing columns** (`columnPositions: false`)
    - the type picker comes from the runtime `pg_type` catalog, schema-qualified outside the
      search_path, with an "array" checkbox (`text[]`, `mood[]`)
    - an "Opciones" tab: comment and `UNLOGGED` editable; owner, tablespace and partition key
      read-only
    - the whole plan in one transaction (DDL is transactional, verified), **except
      `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`**, whose new value cannot be used in the same transaction: the
      planner emits it as a pre-transaction step, like SQLite's `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`
  - **SQLite:**
    - In-place for `RENAME TO`/`RENAME COLUMN`/`ADD COLUMN`/`DROP COLUMN`, plus (in 3.53)
      `ADD/DROP CONSTRAINT CHECK` and `SET/DROP NOT NULL`.
    - Everything else uses the documented rebuild, extended for three verified or reported
      failures (a view on the table breaks the rename with `error in view v: no such table:
main.u`, verified on SQLite 3.53.4; AUTOINCREMENT high-water mark is reset; pre-existing FK
      violations abort every rebuild):
      1. Record the baseline: `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` rows, the table's `sqlite_sequence`
         row, and the `sql` of every index, trigger and view that depends on the table.
      2. `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF` (outside the transaction)
      3. `BEGIN`
      4. `DROP VIEW` / `DROP TRIGGER` for the dependants recorded in step 1
      5. `CREATE TABLE new_x`
      6. `INSERT … SELECT`
      7. `DROP TABLE x`
      8. `ALTER TABLE new_x RENAME TO x`
      9. recreate indexes, triggers and views from the recorded `sql`
      10. restore the `sqlite_sequence` row (`UPDATE sqlite_sequence SET seq = <old> WHERE
name = 'x'`, inserting it if missing)
      11. `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`: abort only on rows **not in the baseline**; pre-existing
          ones are shown as a warning
      12. `COMMIT`
      13. restore `PRAGMA foreign_keys` to the connection's setting

      The plan states `rebuild.reason`, and the UI shows it as a risk, with the optional "copiar
      el archivo antes" (`VACUUM INTO`).

    - "Auto increment" is only offered on `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, and `AUTOINCREMENT` is a separate
      checkbox (without it, SQLite may reuse deleted ids).
  - **TableDraft.** Keeps its shape and gains `options: Record<string, string | number | boolean>`
    for engine table options: MySQL engine, collation, AUTO_INCREMENT and comment; PG comment;
    SQLite `WITHOUT ROWID`/`STRICT`. `ColumnsEditor`, `IndexesEditor` and `ForeignKeysEditor` read
    type, index-method and FK-action lists from `typeCatalog`.

- **DDL editor** (`designer/ddl.ts`, `DdlEditorView.vue`). Templates and `buildDdlScript` come from
  the engine.
  - PG uses `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION/PROCEDURE … $$ … $$` with no DELIMITER, and
    `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS n ON t` followed by CREATE.
  - SQLite uses DROP plus CREATE.
  - The "Quitar DEFINER" switch appears only when `capabilities.definer`.
- **Data grid** (`columnKind.ts`, `rowEditing.ts`, `EditableGrid.vue`).
  - `typeKind` from the driver replaces MySQL type-name regexes. The regexes remain only as a
    fallback. This includes `ResultGrid.vue:13` `NUMERIC_TYPE` (MySQL-only names), which loses
    right alignment for PG `int4/numeric/float8` and SQLite `INTEGER/REAL` otherwise.
  - `keyColumns` follows the driver's `RowIdentity`. With `none`, the grid is read-only with the
    reason shown.
  - `enumValues` gives a dropdown on any engine. JSON/JSONB cells get a pop-up editor
    (pretty-print plus validation); `json` (not `jsonb`) columns are never used in a WHERE.
    SQLite cells show their storage class in the tooltip.
  - `components/data/privileges.ts:4-19` (`friendlyError`) matches MySQL errnos in message text.
    It gains an engine- and code-aware variant using `dialect.isPrivilegeError(code)`; the
    MySQL path is unchanged.
- **Table data view** (`TableDataView.vue`). The raw `WHERE` input stays for SQL engines.
  MongoDB opens `CollectionView` instead (section 9).
- **Shell.**
  - `AppToolbar.vue:59` "Nueva conexión MySQL…" becomes "Nueva conexión ▸ MySQL / MariaDB /
    PostgreSQL / SQLite / MongoDB".
  - The tree row shows the engine icon.
  - Toolbar buttons (Users, Events, Backup, Automation) follow the current connection's
    capabilities.
  - `InfoPanel` renders `ServerInfo.details`.
  - `NewDatabaseDialog` is driven by `createDatabase`: charset for MySQL, encoding/template/owner
    for PG, name plus first collection for MongoDB, hidden for SQLite.
  - Backup and job pickers (`BackupDialog.vue:50`, `RestoreDialog.vue:55,86`,
    `BackupsView.vue:56`, `JobTasksEditor.vue:15`) filter by capability.
  - `SettingsDialog.vue` gains the switch "Motores en vista previa" (D14).

### 8.2 Connection dialog per engine

The engine is chosen first (picker cards). It is fixed for existing connections and shown as a
chip. The tabs are General, SSH, SSL and Avanzado, shown per capability.

The connection menu gains **"Copiar URI"** for MongoDB and PostgreSQL (built from the config,
never containing the password). "Probar conexión" reports, besides the label and version
("Conectado · PostgreSQL 17.11"), the TLS state ("SSL: TLSv1.3" or "sin cifrar"), the SSH hop when
used, and for MongoDB the detected topology and member role. "Guardar contraseña" off
(`savePassword`, `shared/types.ts:17`) must prompt at connect time on every engine, including the
SSH passphrase and the SSL key password.

`connectionForm.ts` defaults come from `descriptor.defaultPort` and `defaultUser`. Validation is
`src/shared/connectionValidation.ts`.

## 9. MongoDB views

### 9.1 Collection browser (`views/CollectionView.vue`, P4a)

- **Toolbar.**
  - Inputs for Filtro `{}`, Orden `{}` and Proyección `{}`. They take shell syntax
    (`{_id: ObjectId('…'), at: {$gt: ISODate('…')}}`) and are parsed in main by
    `@mongodb-js/shell-bson-parser` in strict mode. An empty result counts as a parse error.
    Each input keeps a per-collection history of recent values (per viewer, local only).
  - skip/limit paging (default 100) plus **"Cargar más"** through the open cursor
    (`mongo:getMore`).
  - The count shows `estimatedDocumentCount` when there is no filter, otherwise
    `countDocuments({maxTimeMS: 3000})`, labelled "≈" when not exact.
- **Three modes**, remembered per tab:
  - **Tabla.** Columns are the top-level fields of the sampled page, `_id` first, then by
    frequency. A column whose values have several BSON types shows a "mixto" badge, and each cell
    a type icon. Cells show a shell-syntax preview: `ObjectId('…')`, `ISODate('…')`,
    `NumberLong('…')`, `{…} 3 campos`, `[…] 5`. **Inline editing keeps the cell's BSON type**: the
    editor shows the plain value plus a type dropdown (Int32, Int64, Double, Decimal128, String,
    Boolean, Date, ObjectId, Null, …) that defaults to the current type, and main builds the
    typed value. Typing `5` into an Int32 cell stays Int32 (shell parsing would have made it a
    Double). Nested values open the document editor at that path.
  - **Árbol.** Expandable key, value and type rows (`DocumentTree.vue`) with per-node
    edit/add/remove, using the same typed editor. "Añadir elemento" / "Eliminar elemento" on
    arrays send `$set` of the whole array.
  - **JSON.** One shell-syntax text block per document.
- **Rendering.** The renderer converts canonical EJSON to shell text with
  `src/shared/mongo/shellFormat.ts`, a pure function of about 100 lines that maps `$oid`, `$date`,
  `$numberLong`, `$numberDecimal`, `$numberInt`, `$numberDouble`, `$binary` (subtype 4 and 3 as
  `UUID('…')`), `$timestamp`, `$regularExpression`, `$minKey` and `$maxKey`. The renderer needs no
  `bson` dependency.
- **Dates** show UTC with a `Z` by default, local time in the tooltip, and a per-tab "Hora local"
  toggle. Dates outside years 0–9999 render as `new Date(<ms>)` instead of failing.
- **ObjectId.** "Copiar" gives the hex value; "Copiar como filtro" gives `{_id: ObjectId('…')}`;
  the tooltip shows the creation time embedded in the id.
- **Size limits.** Documents larger than 256 KB are sent truncated (`whole: false`) with a
  "documento grande: abrir completo" action. Nesting deeper than 20 levels is collapsed.
- **Read-only collections.** Capped, time-series and view collections, and GridFS `*.chunks`,
  carry a `readOnlyReason` from `listCollections` options, and the matching server errors are
  mapped.
- **Indexes (read-only).** A collapsible panel lists the collection's indexes from P4a, so users
  can see why a query is slow before the designer arrives (P4b).
- **Collection list columns:** document count, size, storage size, index count and average
  document size (from `$collStats`).

### 9.2 Document editing (P4a)

- `DocumentEditorDialog.vue` edits a document as shell-syntax text. The `_id` line is read-only.
  - **Replace only whole documents.** If the document was fetched whole (`whole[i]`: no
    projection, no inclusion `$project`, not truncated), saving sends
    `{kind: 'replace', fetchedWhole: true}`. Otherwise the editor first **refetches the full
    document by `_id`**; if that is impossible it diffs the edit and sends `$set`/`$unset`. Main
    refuses `replace` without `fetchedWhole`. `replaceOne` on a projected document would delete
    every field that was not shown.
- Inline grid and tree edits send `{kind: 'update', set, unset, expected}` with dotted paths.
  - **Optimistic check.** The filter is `{_id, <path>: <original value>, …}` for every edited
    path. `matchedCount === 0` reports "El documento ha cambiado desde que se cargó; recarga".
  - **Arrays.** Removing or inserting an element sends `$set` of the whole array; `$unset` on
    `tags.2` would leave `null`.
  - **Field names containing `.` or starting with `$`** cannot be addressed by dotted path. In
    v1 those fields are read-only inline with "Edita el documento completo".
- In main, `changes.ts` parses each value with shell-bson-parser (strict) or
  `EJSON.parse(text, {relaxed: false})`. It filters by the **original `_id` value of any BSON
  type**, and applies `updateOne($set/$unset)`, `replaceOne`, `insertOne` or `deleteOne`.
  Verified: ObjectId, Decimal128 and Long survive the round trip.
- Errors map to Spanish messages: `121` "El documento no cumple el validador" plus a summary of
  `errInfo` (not logged), `11000` "Clave duplicada en el índice …" (a `ServerError`, so the key
  value is never logged), and `13` "Sin permisos".
- Batches use a transaction only on replica sets or mongos. Elsewhere they apply one by one and
  report per-row results.
- New documents use "Insertar documento" (shell text), prefilled with the sampled field names and
  typed placeholders (`ObjectId()`, `new Date()`, `NumberInt(0)`); `_id` is generated by the
  driver when absent. "Duplicar documento" copies a document without `_id` into the same editor.

### 9.3 Query editor (`QueryView.vue` with a MongoDB branch)

- **P4a: reads.** `find`, `findOne`, `aggregate` (without `$out`/`$merge`), `countDocuments`,
  `estimatedDocumentCount`, `distinct`, `getIndexes`, `explain`, plus a fixed whitelist of
  read-only commands: `db.stats()`, `db.coll.stats()`, `db.currentOp()`, `db.serverStatus()`,
  `db.version()`, `db.getCollectionNames()`, `rs.status()`, mapped to `dbStats`, `collStats`,
  `currentOp`, `serverStatus`, `buildInfo`, `listCollections` and `replSetGetStatus`. **P4b:
  writes** (`insertOne/Many`, `updateOne/Many`, `replaceOne`, `deleteOne/Many`,
  `findOneAndUpdate/Replace/Delete`, `bulkWrite`, `createIndex`, `dropIndex`, `drop`).
- **Grammar** (a whitelist; acorn parses each top-level statement as one expression):
  - `db.<coll>.<method>(args)` with chained modifiers, plus `db.getCollection('x')` and
    `db['my-coll']`.
  - `use <db>`, `show dbs` and `show collections` are handled before parsing.
  - Modifiers: `sort`, `limit`, `skip`, `project`, `hint`, `collation`, `maxTimeMS`.
  - **Pasted mongosh tolerance.** `.pretty()`, `.toArray()` and `.itcount()` are accepted as
    no-ops; `.count()` maps to `countDocuments`. `var`/`const`/`let` and `.forEach(…)` get a clear
    error with a hint. Before P4a is done, a test confirms that shell-bson-parser strict mode
    accepts `new Date()`, `ISODate()`, no-argument `ObjectId()`, regex literals, `UUID('…')` and
    `Date.now()`; the probe only checked safety, not this coverage.
  - Anything else is rejected with its source position: "Solo se admiten llamadas
    db.colección.método(...)". `runCommand` and any command outside the whitelist are refused.
- **Arguments** are the source slices of each argument node, parsed with shell-bson-parser in
  strict mode. User code is never `eval`'d, `vm`'d or `Function`'d.
- **Results.** `MongoCommandResult` has `kind: 'documents' | 'write' | 'value'`.
  - Documents use the same three-mode viewer, with "Cargar más", and are editable when the rule
    in section 5.4 holds.
  - Writes show matched, modified, inserted, deleted and upserted counts.
  - Values show text.
  - Row caps use `find().batchSize(500).limit(cap+1)`. Aggregates get a `$limit` appended **at
    the end**, never inserted before `$group` or other stages.
- **Completion** suggests:
  - collection names after `db.`
  - methods after `db.x.`
  - `$` operators inside objects
  - sampled field paths from `mongo:sampleFields`, cached per collection

### 9.4 Aggregation pipeline editor (`views/AggregateView.vue`, P4b)

- A list of stages. Each stage has an operator select (`$match`, `$project`, `$group`, `$sort`,
  `$limit`, `$lookup`, `$unwind`, `$addFields`, `$count`, …), a body editor (shell syntax), an
  enable switch and drag reorder.
- "Vista previa en esta etapa" runs the pipeline up to stage _i_ with `$limit 20` appended at the
  end (`mongo:aggregate` with `previewStage`) and shows the stage's document count.
- "Copiar como comando" generates `db.coll.aggregate([...])` for the query editor.
- A pipeline that contains `$out` or `$merge` is a write and goes through the production guard.

### 9.5 Collection designer (`views/CollectionDesignerView.vue`, P4b)

This is MongoDB's "table designer" (`capabilities.designer === 'collection'`).

- **Índices:** list and create. Options:
  - key fields with 1, -1, text, 2dsphere or hashed
  - unique, sparse
  - TTL (`expireAfterSeconds`)
  - partial filter
  - collation
  - hidden

  Dropping an index needs confirmation. `_id_` cannot be dropped.

- **Validador:** a `$jsonSchema` editor (shell syntax), plus `validationLevel` and
  `validationAction`. Saving runs `collMod`.
- **Opciones:** read-only (capped/size, timeseries, view `viewOn` + pipeline).
- A "Generar esquema" helper proposes a `$jsonSchema` from `mongo:sampleFields` (optional).

---

## 10. Production guard per engine

Shared rule (unchanged): main checks the guard for every write channel, and the renderer asks
first and sends `confirmProduction: true`. Two functions per dialect (D13):

- **Renderer, `dialect.analyzeWrites(script)`** is an **allowlist**: a statement is a read only
  if it is provably read-only; anything else is a write, with a Spanish reason for the dialog
  ("DELETE sin WHERE", "Función con efectos: pg_terminate_backend", "PRAGMA de escritura", …).
  `QueryView.vue:224-247` shows these reasons.
- **Main, `dialect.isObviousWrite(statement)`** is a small **denylist**. Main must never flag
  what the renderer lets through without asking, so for every dialect a test asserts
  `isObviousWrite(s) ⇒ analyzeWrites(s).writes` over the whole corpus.

`ipc/productionGuard.ts` `assertScriptAllowed(ctx, id, script)` looks up the connection's engine,
then uses `dialect.splitStatements` and `dialect.isObviousWrite` (or the MongoDB classifier).

| Engine     | Renderer allowlist (`analyzeWrites` read rules)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Main denylist (`isObviousWrite`)                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Repro that motivated the SQLite rules (verified on SQLite 3.53.4):
`PRAGMA query_only(0); WITH t AS (SELECT 1) DELETE FROM users` used to pass as two reads, the
first one switching off the read-only safety net.

**Defence in depth on production connections (new engines only, so MySQL is unchanged):**

- **PostgreSQL.** Production tab sessions and pooled sessions run with
  `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION READ ONLY` (verified: writes then fail with
  `25006`), re-applied together with the pinned settings after every `DISCARD ALL`. When a script contains a confirmed write, main runs `SET SESSION
default_transaction_read_only = off` before that script and restores `on` after it, unless a
  transaction is open, in which case it restores it when the transaction ends. A transaction the
  user opened under a read-only script stays read-only; a confirmed write in it fails with
  "La transacción se abrió en modo solo lectura: ejecuta ROLLBACK y repite el script con la
  escritura". **No `BEGIN READ ONLY … COMMIT` wrapper**: its `COMMIT` would commit the user's own
  open transaction halfway through a script. A side effect hidden in a function
  (`SELECT my_func()`) fails with `25006`. Functions that bypass read-only transactions
  (`pg_terminate_backend`, `pg_cancel_backend`, `pg_reload_conf`, `dblink_exec`,
  `pg_advisory_lock`) are caught by the function denylist above.
- **SQLite.** `readOnly` defaults to true for production, with "Reabrir en modo escritura" (with
  confirmation) as the explicit way to write. On a read-write production connection, reads run
  with `PRAGMA query_only=ON`, and `query_only` itself can only be changed by a confirmed write.
- **MongoDB.** `mongo:execute` refuses `runCommand` and any method or command not on the
  whitelist. On production, writes need confirmation like every other engine.

## 11. Backups and automation stay MySQL-only

> **Phase 4b update (.vqb).** Backups are no longer MySQL-only: Vortaq's own format `.vqb`
> (`docs/vqb-format.md`) is the default for new backups and is the only backup format of
> PostgreSQL (capability `supportsBackupsVqb`; `hasBackups()` = `.nb3` or `.vqb`). `.nb3` stays
> MySQL-only (the gates below still apply to it), restores go to the same engine only, and
> automation stays MySQL-only (`supportsAutomation`), so PostgreSQL has no job steps, packages or
> «Restaurar todo» yet.

All of these gates are checked in main and mirrored in the UI (coupling §5).

A `mysql` connection whose server turns out to be MariaDB keeps backups (D4), with the pre-backup
warning for system-versioned tables and sequences (section 5.6). **No other backup code changes:**
the MariaDB-unknown `SET SESSION information_schema_stats_expiry` is already best effort
(`withFreshStats`, `backup/create.ts:105-126`, wraps it in try/catch), so revision 1's proposed
flavour guard there is dropped.

## 12. Navicat import for every engine

Facts from the user's own files (`docs/navicat-storage.md`), from `.ncx` files exported with
Navicat's own export and from the public Navicat manual:

- macOS Navicat writes **one** `Common/conn.plist`, shaped `<user>/<project>/<TypeKey>/<name>`.
  `MySQL` is verified on the user's files; the other type keys (`MariaDB`, `PostgreSQL`,
  `SQLite`, `MongoDB`, and the unsupported `SQL Server`, `Oracle`, `Redis`, `Snowflake`, `ODBC`)
  follow the product names of the manual and are confirmed only with user-provided samples (open
  question 1). Cloud flavours are a `serviceprovider` inside the base type.
- Colours live at `pref.plist` `connpref/<u>/<p>/<TypeKey>/<name>/""/""/serverpref/markercolor`.
- **Passwords are not in any file Navicat leaves in the user's folder.** Vortaq does not read
  Navicat's keychain items or any other application's private data; passwords are typed by the
  user or come from an `.ncx` the user exports.
- An `.ncx` exported with **Export Password** carries the passwords encrypted with the fixed
  scheme of that file format (AES-128-CBC in current versions, Blowfish in older ones).
  `src/main/importers/navicat/ncxCipher.ts` implements and tests both; it is used only for `.ncx`
  files the user exports.

**When each part ships (D11).** The generic plumbing (type sections, `(navicatType, name)`
identity, `savepath`, colours, preview rows for unsupported types) ships in **PN**, together with
`.ncx` password import, MySQL first. Each engine's field mapping then ships **in that engine's
phase**: PostgreSQL in P2a, SQLite in P3, MongoDB in P4a, MariaDB in P5. Until its phase is done,
an engine's rows are previewed but not importable ("Disponible en una próxima versión"), and
preview engines follow the preview flag (D14).

**Confidence.** Several non-MySQL plist encodings are unverified (`ssl_param.mode`,
`connmethod`, `authmechanism`, `readpreference`, the shape of `memberlist` and
`attacheddatabases`). The local install is Navicat for MySQL only, so they cannot be confirmed
here. Anonymised samples from the user or a Navicat Premium trial (open question 1) are needed
**before P2a's import is finished**, not at the end. Parsing is tolerant meanwhile: an unknown
value becomes the default plus a warning.

### 12.1 `conn.plist` (macOS)

- `connPlist.ts:115-126`: `mysqlSections()` becomes `typeSections()`, walking every
  `<user>/<project>/<TypeKey>`. A table maps type keys to parsers:
  - `MySQL` → mysql
  - `MariaDB` → mariadb, using the same keys as MySQL
  - `PostgreSQL` → postgresql: `initialdatabase`, `ssl_param.mode` read case- and
    separator-insensitively (including `allow`), `usecustomdblist` as an **int**,
    `ssl_param.rootcert`/`crlfile`. `hostportlist` imports the first host with the warning
    "Solo se usa el primer host". `serviceprovider` `Redshift`, `HuaweiCloudGaussDB*`,
    `HuaweiOpenGauss` and `KingbaseES` give `engine: null` with "Servidor compatible con
    PostgreSQL no soportado: <proveedor>" (their catalogs lack `prokind`, `attidentity` or
    `pg_get_functiondef`); other providers (`Default`, RDS, Aurora, Google Cloud, Azure,
    `IvorySQL`, `FujitsuEnterprise`) import as `postgresql`.
  - `SQLite` → sqlite: `databasefile`; `sqliteencrypted` produces the unsupported reason
    "cifrada — no soportado"; `attacheddatabases` is listed as a warning until its inner shape is
    confirmed
  - `MongoDB` → mongodb: `connmethod`, `usesrvrecord`, `memberlist`, `replicasetname`,
    `authsource`, `authmechanism` (with `Kerberos` giving an unsupported reason) and
    `readpreference`, `retrywrites`/`retryreads` and timeouts, all case-insensitive, accepting
    both `ReplicaSet` and `Replica Set`. `serviceprovider` `DocumentDB` and `AzureCosmosDB` force
    `retryWrites: false` (with a note); `MongoDBAtlas` and SRV turn TLS on.
  - every other type → preview row with `engine: null` and "Tipo de conexión no soportado:
    SQL Server"
- Identity becomes `(navicatType, name)` instead of name only (`connPlist.ts:147-149`,
  `importer.ts:80-96`). Existing imported connections without `source.navicatType` count as
  `MySQL`.
- `paths.ts:11-31`: use each connection's **`savepath` as stored** instead of rebuilding
  `Settings/0/0/MySQL/<name>`. Backup-directory resolution and `.nb3` counting run for MySQL only.
- `colors.ts:83-100`: read colours for every type key and identity.
- `detect.ts`: report counts per type.

### 12.2 `.ncx` import (all platforms, the password route)

- New `src/main/importers/navicat/ncx.ts` with `parseNcx(xml)`. It uses `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.9.12, already
  installed through `plist`, promoted to a direct dependency. It reads only direct
  `<Connection>` children and their `<Member>`/`<Advance>` children, and tolerates a BOM.
- **Versions.**
  - 1.1 and 1.4 write the union schema (every attribute on every connection).
  - **1.5 omits default/off attributes**, so every attribute is optional with a per-engine
    default.
  - Decryption is chosen by `Ver` (< 1.4 → the Blowfish scheme; otherwise AES, then Blowfish),
    with a strict UTF-8 check (`decodeNcxPassword` in `ncxCipher.ts`).
- **`ConnType`** values are `MYSQL`, `MARIADB`, `POSTGRESQL`, `SQLITE` and `MONGODB`, compared
  case-insensitively. `SQLSERVER`, `ORACLE`, `REDIS`, `SNOWFLAKE` and unknown values are skipped
  with a reason. Note that the values are not `PGSQL`/`MSSQL`.
- **MongoDB replica sets.** `Host="localhost"` is a placeholder. The seeds come from `<Member>`
  and the database from `<Advance Database>`.
- **Secrets.** `Password`, `SSH_Password`, `SSH_Passphrase` and `SSL_PEMClientKeyPassword` go only
  to `CredentialStore`, and only when present and decryptable. They are never logged. The single
  `ssh` slot takes `SSH_Passphrase` when `SSH_AuthenMethod="PUBLICKEY"` and `SSH_Password`
  otherwise. `SSL_PEMClientKeyPassword` goes to the `sslKey` slot. The UI
  reminds the user: "Este archivo contiene contraseñas recuperables: bórralo después de importar."
- **Foreign paths.** A path that is not absolute on the current platform (a `C:\…` path on
  macOS, a POSIX path on Windows, which would resolve against the current drive) is stored with
  `pathNeedsReview: true` and the warning "Ruta de otro equipo: revísala". Such a connection
  cannot open (and never creates a file, invariant 8) until the user picks a file.
  `SettingsSavePath` is ignored off its own machine. `HTTP="true"` gives "Túnel HTTP no
  soportado".
- **Logging.** Preview and import warnings (foreign paths, connection names) go to the renderer
  only; `ipc/navicat.ts` logs counts, never the warning text, for the new channels.
- **Merge.** An `.ncx` connection whose `(ConnType, ConnectionName)` matches an existing imported
  connection updates only its secrets (`passwordsOnly`) unless the user picks "reemplazar". This
  is how a user brings Mac passwords across: import the plist for metadata and colours, then
  import the `.ncx` for passwords.
- **Renderer.** *Done in v0.2.0 as the «Importar…» wizard* (`components/import/ImportWizard.vue`, sources in
  `src/main/importers/registry.ts`): the `.ncx` is one source next to the Navicat folder (which keeps
  `ImportNavicatDialog.vue`), DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, `.sql` dumps, dump folders and `.nb3`. The original
  plan was: `ImportNavicatDialog.vue` with source tabs "Navicat de este Mac" and "Archivo .ncx".
  Columns: engine icon, name, host or file, environment, "contraseña incluida", status
  (importable / ya importada / no soportada + reason) and warnings. The empty text becomes "No
  hay conexiones en Navicat".

### 12.3 No keychain access; Windows and Linux

- **Removed in v0.2.0.** The earlier "recover passwords from the Keychain" button and its
  `navicat:recoverPasswords` channel are gone. Vortaq never lists or reads another application's
  keychain items; after an import the user types each password, or imports an `.ncx` exported
  with Export Password.
- **Windows.** Navicat for Windows keeps its connections in the registry; reading it is not
  planned. Windows users export `.ncx` (the same route as every other platform).
- **Linux.** Linux users export `.ncx`.

### 12.4 Docs

`docs/navicat-storage.md` gets a per-type section and these corrections:

- `usecustomdblist` is an int.
- The extra MySQL keys are listed.
- The keychain row is removed (done in v0.2.0).
- `.ncx` format notes are added, from files the user exports.
- Unverified keys are marked as such.

CLAUDE.md requires reading this doc before touching import code.

## 13. Credentials

- `credentials/store.ts:22` `SecretKind = 'mysql' | 'ssh'` keeps its stored prefix. A TS constant
  `DB_PASSWORD: SecretKind = 'mysql'` carries the comment "generic database password slot; the
  prefix predates multi-engine". All engines use it, so no migration is needed (D10).
- New kinds are added only when needed: `'sslKey'` for the SSL client-key password, from P2a
  (the PG dialog needs it before `.ncx` import).
- `deleteAll` (`store.ts:88-91`) removes every kind, including `sslKey`, so deleting a
  connection leaves no orphaned secret. A test enumerates `SecretKind` to keep it in sync.
- A MongoDB URI pasted in the dialog has its password moved to the credential store and stripped
  from the stored config. **Query parameters that carry secrets** (`authMechanismProperties` such
  as `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword`, `proxyPassword`, `password`) are
  refused with "La URI contiene credenciales en los parámetros: quítalas". The raw URI is never
  stored, logged or echoed.
- **Linux secret storage (to verify).** `safeStorage.isEncryptionAvailable()` is reportedly true
  with the `basic_text` backend (a hardcoded key), so `bootstrap.ts:14-22,103-109` may never show
  PLAIN_SECRETS_NOTICE on keyring-less desktops. Check `safeStorage.getSelectedStorageBackend()`
  in PN, before `.ncx` import brings more production secrets onto Linux machines.

- `electron.vite.config.ts` adds a second main input `sqliteWorker: src/main/sqlite/worker.ts`.
  `utilityProcess.fork(join(__dirname, 'sqliteWorker.js'))`. Whether `utilityProcess.fork` can
  start a script **inside `app.asar`** is unverified; if the packaged smoke (15.4) fails, the
  worker goes to `asarUnpack`.
- `externalizeDepsPlugin` keeps `pg` and `mongodb` external. The MongoDB driver requires its
  optional modules lazily inside try/catch, so missing modules surface only as the verified "module
  not found" messages.
- `npmRebuild: false`, the asar layout and cross-building from the Mac are unchanged. Licences are
  MIT and Apache-2.0 only. Avoid `mariadb` (LGPL) and `better-sqlite3` (native, no Electron 44
  prebuilds).
- `package.json` `engines.node` becomes `>=24` in P3: `StatementSync.columns()` needs ≥ 23.11 and
  `setReturnArrays` needs ≥ 24.0, for vitest running `core.ts` outside Electron.
- Expected app size growth is about 10 MB (pg ≈ 0.9 MB, mongodb + bson ≈ 6.4 MB, parsers ≈
  0.8 MB). Each open SQLite connection adds one Electron utility process (tens of MB), hence the
  cap of 4.

## 15. Testing strategy

### 15.1 Unit tests (vitest `node` project; `*.test.ts` next to the code, no `electron` imports)

- **Dialects** (table-driven, one corpus per engine):
  - splitter cases: MySQL `DELIMITER`, `/*!`/`/*M!`; PG `$tag$` nested, `E'\''`, nested
    comments, `#>>`/`?|`; SQLite trigger `BEGIN…END`, `[ident]`
  - guard corpus per dialect, run through both functions, plus the property
    `isObviousWrite(s) ⇒ analyzeWrites(s).writes`. Must include: PG writable CTE,
    `SELECT … INTO`, `COPY … TO STDOUT` vs `FROM`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE <write>`,
    `SELECT pg_terminate_backend(1)`, `SELECT set_config(…)`, `SELECT nextval(…)`, `SET ROLE`,
    `SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS … READ WRITE`, `DISCARD ALL`, `CHECKPOINT`; SQLite
    `PRAGMA table_info(t)` (read), `PRAGMA query_only` (read), `PRAGMA query_only(0)`,
    `PRAGMA query_only = 0`, `PRAGMA optimize`, `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint`,
    `WITH t AS (SELECT 1) DELETE FROM u` (writes)
  - quoting and PG case folding, completion with mixed-case and reserved names
  - `selectPage`
  - **MySQL golden tests:** every existing splitter, guard (both functions, including the dialog
    reasons) and quoting test moves next to `dialects/mysql.ts` unchanged.
- **Drivers without a server:**
  - PG type-parser table, `resultSource` SQL builder, SSL mode → options mapping (including
    `allow`), **ambient-credential test** (`PGPASSWORD`, `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE` and a temp
    `PGPASSFILE` set; none used), search_path composition (keeps `public` and dedupes)
  - MariaDB default unquoting, flavour detection, backup-warning object list, auth plugins (P5)
  - SQLite `core.ts` against temp files (runs everywhere, Node 24): missing path refused and
    **not created**; a `C:\…` path on POSIX refused; ATTACH path bound as a parameter; rowid
    identity with shadowed `rowid`/`_rowid_`/`oid`; storage classes kept
  - Mongo URI/options builder (SRV implies TLS, replica set, SSH forcing `directConnection`,
    SRV+SSH rejected, credential query parameters refused, DocumentDB forcing
    `retryWrites=false`, credentials never in the URI given to the client)
  - EJSON round trip (Long > 2^53, Decimal128, ObjectId, Date out of 0–9999, Binary, UUID)
  - shell grammar whitelist and safety: `''` → error; `process.exit()`, IIFE and `Math.floor()`
    rejected; pasted-snippet tolerance (`.pretty()`, `.count()`, `new Date()`, `ObjectId()`,
    `/re/i`, `UUID('…')`)
  - `classify.ts`
- **DDL planners:** snapshot tests per engine (create; alter type/null/default/rename/index/FK;
  PG reorder refused; PG `ADD VALUE` emitted before the transaction; SQLite rebuild order with
  dependent views/triggers dropped and recreated, `sqlite_sequence` restored, and the FK
  baseline).
- **Repo and IPC:** `engine` normalisation, engine immutability **through
  `ConnectionsRepo.save`** (and therefore through the importer), capability rejections (backups,
  jobs, `db:events` on a fake PG connection), string `SchemaRef` rejected for PG,
  `IPC_INVOKE_CHANNELS` parity, `deleteAll` covering every `SecretKind`.
- **Logging:** a value-echoing `ServerError` and Navicat warnings with foreign paths pass through
  the IPC error and import paths; the captured log contains neither the value nor the path.
- **Navicat:**
  - a synthetic multi-type `conn.plist` and `pref.plist` (PG with each `ssl_param.mode` spelling,
    Redshift provider, `hostportlist`; Mongo DocumentDB provider)
  - synthetic `.ncx` fixtures built with `encryptNavicat11`/`encryptNavicat12`: Ver 1.1 union,
    1.4, 1.5 sparse, no-password export, Mongo replica set with `<Member>`/`<Advance>`, SQLite
    with a Windows path (flagged `pathNeedsReview`), SSH password vs passphrase, skipped types,
    BOM, XML entities
  - **No real hosts, users or data** (CLAUDE.md).

### 15.2 Web tests (vitest `web` project)

- `ConnectionDialog` per engine: fields, validation, URI paste (credential parameters refused),
  "Copiar URI" without password
- tree with the PG database level, closed databases, node-id escaping, two databases with the same
  `public.users` opening two tabs
- query toolbar: PG database + schema combos, transaction state, close-tab prompt
- menus and toolbar per capability; MySQL menus unchanged (snapshot)
- `ResultGrid` alignment from `typeKind`
- `CollectionView` modes, typed inline editor, "Cargar más"
- `shellFormat` rendering (UTC/local dates, UUID)
- `DocumentTree` editing (array element removal sends whole-array `$set`)

### 15.3 Integration tests and the MySQL gate

Today the gate can pass without testing anything: `tests/integration/mysql.test.ts:57` and
`backup.test.ts:115` use `describe.skipIf(!url)`, `npm run check` never sets the URL, there is no
CI (`.github/` is absent), and the tests pin MySQL 8.4 (`mysql.test.ts:124,129,855`) while the
user's production server is MySQL 5.7. Changes, all in P1a:

- **`npm run test:integration:required`** sets `VORTAQ_REQUIRE_INTEGRATION=1`; with it, a
  missing URL makes the suite **fail** instead of skip. Every phase's "done when" uses this
  command, not `test:integration`.
- **MySQL 5.7 and 8.4.** `tests/docker-compose.yml` (new) declares throwaway containers bound to
  `127.0.0.1` and never on 3306/3307: `mysql:8.4` on **33306** (the existing test container) and
  `mysql:5.7` on **33357** (amd64-only image, runs emulated on Apple Silicon with
  `platform: linux/amd64`). Version-pinned expectations become per-version. The MySQL and backup
  suites run against both.
- The other engines join the same compose file in their phases:

| Engine     | Env var (`VORTAQ_` prefix; `ELECTRONDB_`/`NAVIDOG_` accepted) | Container (never ports 3306/3307)                                                                                                                                                                   | Phase |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| MySQL      | `TEST_MYSQL_URL` (existing), `TEST_MYSQL57_URL`               | `mysql:8.4` on 33306, `mysql:5.7` on 33357                                                                                                                                                          | P1a   |
| MariaDB    | `TEST_MARIADB_URL`                                            | `mariadb:11` on **33316**                                                                                                                                                                           | P1b   |
| PostgreSQL | `TEST_PG_URL`                                                 | `postgres:17` on **55432**, with `uuid-ossp` and `pgcrypto` created in `public`                                                                                                                     | P2a   |
| SQLite     | none (always runs)                                            | temp files built from `tests/fixtures/sqlite/*.sql` (WITHOUT ROWID, STRICT, generated columns, views on rebuilt tables, triggers, FKs with a pre-existing violation, AUTOINCREMENT, BLOB, big ints) | P3    |
| MongoDB    | `TEST_MONGO_URL`, `TEST_MONGO_RS_URL`                         | `mongo:8.2` on **57017** (standalone) and **57018** (`--replSet rs0`, single node, for transactions). **Pin 8.2:** `mongo:8` (8.3.x) refuses to start on Docker Desktop kernels ≥ 6.19.             | P4a   |

- **Driver conformance suite** (`tests/integration/driverContract.ts`), run per SQL engine:
  - open/test/close
  - list databases, schemas and objects
  - create a table **from the engine's DdlPlanner output**
  - insert, update and delete through `applyRowChanges`, with insert-id read-back
  - **insert with an omitted default/identity column** (and `GENERATED ALWAYS` read-only)
  - editable-result metadata through join, alias and view (expect refusal)
  - `maxRows` truncation
  - the value-fidelity contract per type, under the pinned session settings
  - error mapping, with server values absent from the log
  - cancel, including a late cancel that must not hit the next statement
  - tab session: `BEGIN` in one run and `COMMIT` in the next; a guard read on production does
    not commit the user's open transaction
  - **search_path keeps the extension schema** (`uuid_generate_v4()` works with the tab on a
    non-`public` schema)
  - **AUTOINCREMENT high-water mark survives a SQLite rebuild**; a rebuild with a dependent
    view succeeds; a pre-existing FK violation does not abort it
  - the production guard rejecting an unconfirmed write

  MongoDB has a parallel document suite, which includes **"Int32 stays Int32 after inline
  edit"**, **"replace refused on a projected document"**, array element removal, the optimistic
  conflict message, and read-only reasons for capped/time-series/view collections.

### 15.4 Packaged-app smoke (all three platforms)

`node:sqlite` and `utilityProcess` were verified only unpackaged on macOS, and v0.1.0 has no
Windows or Linux artifacts, so there is no baseline. `scripts/smoke-packaged.mjs` (new, P3) runs
against the output of `npm run dist`: start the app, fork the SQLite worker from the packaged
layout, open/query/cancel-by-kill/reopen, and load `pg` and `mongodb` (later also the
`@noble/*` ESM modules). It runs on macOS, Windows x64 and Linux x64 (AppImage) before any
prerelease that touches P3 or later code. It is manual until CI exists (open question 9).

## 16. Phased implementation plan

> **Release policy (decided by the user, 2026-10-05 — overrides any other text in this document):**
>
> - `main` is the stable MySQL-only line and the only source of "Latest" releases (v0.1.x). MySQL
>   fixes land on `main` and are released as v0.1.1, v0.1.2… only after the user approves each one.
> - All multi-engine work (every phase P1a…P5) stays on `feature/multi-engine` (and phase branches
>   cut from it). It is NOT merged into `main` and never published as "Latest". Test builds, if the
>   user asks for them, are GitHub pre-releases only.
> - The multi-engine line becomes a new version (e.g. 0.2.0) and is merged/released only when the
>   user explicitly approves it. The "each phase merges into main behind the preview flag" rule
>   below is superseded: phases merge into `feature/multi-engine` instead.

Each phase ends with `npm run check` green, `npm run test:integration:required` green for MySQL
5.7 and 8.4 and for every engine shipped so far, CLAUDE.md "Layout" updated when folders change,
and a demo checklist run by hand. Each phase merges into `main` on its own and leaves `main`
releasable: unfinished engines are behind the preview flag, and builds are prereleases (D14).

Order and parallelism:

```
P0 (done) ─► P1a ─┬─► P1b (MariaDB fixes) ────────────────────────────────┐
                  ├─► PN (Navicat plumbing + .ncx passwords) ─────────────┤
                  └─► P2a (PG read + tab sessions) ─┬─► P2b (PG edit) ─────┼─► P4a ─► P4b ─► P5 (MariaDB engine)
                                                    └─► P3 (SQLite) ───────┘
```

### P0. Baseline release — **done**

The user asked to keep the current stable version as the repo's **first "latest"** before any
multi-engine work goes up. Verified read-only on 2026-10-05:

- `origin/main` = `c147306`, `package.json` 0.1.0.
- Annotated tag `v0.1.0` is pushed and points to `c147306`.
- The GitHub Release "ElectronDB v0.1.0 — primera versión estable" (the earlier product name) is
  published as **Latest** (not draft, not prerelease) with `ElectronDB-0.1.0-arm64.dmg` and
  `ElectronDB-0.1.0-arm64-mac.zip`.

Remaining, each needing the user's go-ahead (open question 2):

- Cut `release/0.1.x` from `v0.1.0` for hotfixes, since `main` will carry the refactor.
- Optionally build x64 macOS, Windows and Linux artifacts from `v0.1.0` and attach them, so those
  platforms also have a stable fallback.
- Policy from now on: nothing from `feature/multi-engine` is tagged or released as Latest; every
  multi-engine build is a **prerelease** until the user promotes one.

### P1a. Engine abstraction with MySQL behind it (no behaviour change)

Split into PRs, each green and releasable on its own:

1. **Test gate** (15.3): `test:integration:required`, compose file with MySQL 5.7 and 8.4,
   per-version expectations. Lands first so every later PR is measured by it.
2. **Model:** `engine`, engine blocks, neutral metadata types, `SchemaRef`/`NameRef`,
   `ServerInfo.runtime`, `src/shared/engines.ts` (only `mysql` used; preview flag),
   `connectionValidation.ts`, normalisation and engine immutability in `ConnectionsRepo`,
   `SettingsDialog` preview switch.
3. **Dialects:** `src/shared/dialects/{types,index,mysql}.ts` wrapping today's functions
   (`splitStatements`, `isObviousWrite`, `analyzeWrites` with reasons, quoting), moved verbatim
   and re-exported from the old paths.
4. **Main split:** `src/main/db/{driver,registry,manager,errors,tunnel,query,tableData,rowChanges}`,
   `mysql/driver.ts` adapter, `DbUserError`/`ServerError`, tunnel move with a re-export shim,
   backup/automation capability gates, `deleteAll` over every kind, `closeAll` logging only
   `describeForLog`.
5. **Renderer:** engine UI registry (`engines/mysql.ts` wraps today's modules), `typeKind`/
   `primary`/`kind` with MySQL regex fallback (including `ResultGrid.vue:13`), capability-driven
   menus/toolbar/pickers, escaped tree ids, `database` fields on tabs and saved queries (unused
   by MySQL).

- **Tests.** Existing suites unchanged apart from import paths; MySQL dialect golden corpus
  (both guard functions); repo normalisation and immutability through the importer; capability
  rejections with a fake `engine: 'postgresql'` config; tree id escaping (a name containing `:`);
  web snapshot of MySQL menus.
- **Done when.**
  - `npm run check` and `npm run test:integration:required` pass against MySQL 5.7 and 8.4 with
    unchanged expectations (apart from per-version splits).
  - The diff of `introspect.ts`/`rowChanges.ts`/`tableData.ts`/`backup/*` shows no MySQL SQL
    literal changed.
  - Manual smoke on a MySQL connection: open an imported connection, browse, edit the grid,
    editable query result, designer alter, DDL editor, users, backup + restore, run a job,
    production confirmation with the same dialog reasons. All identical.
- **Risks.** Large diff (mitigated by the PR series and golden tests); `MysqlUserError`
  `instanceof` sites (subclass); tunnel move (shim); persisted tree expansion keyed by old node
  ids is reset once (acceptable, noted in release notes).

### P1b. MariaDB fixes for `mysql` connections (small)

- **Scope.** Flavour detection (`ServerInfo.runtime.flavor`); system-versioned tables listed and
  editable; `COLUMN_DEFAULT` unquoting; users from `mysql.global_priv`; count timeout with
  `SET STATEMENT max_statement_time`; extended type labels; INVISIBLE columns selected
  explicitly; MariaDB default collation in the designer; **pre-backup warning** for
  system-versioned tables and sequences. All keyed on the detected flavour, so MySQL servers are
  untouched. No separate engine, no new dialect, no auth plugins (moved to P5).
- **Tests.** `mariadb:11` on 33316 running the MySQL integration expectations that apply, plus
  default-unquote table, system-versioned listing, users view, count timeout, designer round
  trip, backup warning listing names.
- **Done when.** A `mysql` connection to MariaDB 11 lists and edits system-versioned tables,
  shows users, designs tables, and warns before a backup that would skip objects; the MySQL 5.7
  and 8.4 suites are unchanged.

### PN. Navicat import plumbing and `.ncx` passwords

- **Scope.** `typeSections()` over every `conn.plist` type key; identity `(navicatType, name)`;
  `savepath` as stored; colours and `detect.ts` per type; preview rows for every type (non-MySQL
  rows "Disponible en una próxima versión" or unsupported with reason); `src/main/navicat/ncx.ts`
  with `navicat:previewNcx`/`navicat:importNcx`, merge (`passwordsOnly` vs "reemplazar"), SSH
  password/passphrase rule, `sslKey` slot; `ImportNavicatDialog.vue` source tabs and delete-file
  reminder; warnings never logged; Linux `safeStorage` backend check; the import result points to
  `.ncx` for passwords; `docs/navicat-storage.md` per-type section and corrections.
- **Done when.**
  - The preview lists every section of a synthetic multi-type `conn.plist` with its type;
    unsupported types and providers are disabled with a reason.
  - Importing a synthetic `.ncx` (Ver 1.1, 1.4, 1.5) brings passwords into matching existing
    MySQL imports without touching their other fields.
  - If the user provides their own `.ncx` (open question 3), it imports passwords for their MySQL
    connections.
  - A log-capture test shows no secrets, foreign paths or connection names in `vortaq.log`.
- **Not testable locally:** the non-MySQL plist sections of a real install (Navicat for MySQL
  only here). Their field mapping is finished in each engine's phase, with samples (open
  question 1).

### P2a. PostgreSQL: connect, explore, read and query

- **Scope.** `pg` driver with explicit credentials (no env/pgpass), SSL modes including `allow`,
  SSH with SNI, timeouts and keepalive, pinned session settings, production read-only session;
  pool per database with closed/open databases, `datallowconn` filtering; database → schema tree
  with groups (`types` read-only), partitions nested, string `SchemaRef`
  rejected; read-only table grid (editing comes in P2b); **generic tab-session infrastructure**
  (`sessionKey`, `db:sessionState/commit/rollback/closeSession`, close-tab prompt) and the PG tab
  session with the search_path rule and `effectiveSchema` read-back; PG query toolbar with
  database + schema combos; PG dialect (split, both guard functions, function denylist);
  completion; notices; error positions; `db:cancel` bound to running executions; DDL viewer for
  every object; "Copiar URI"; "Probar conexión" with TLS/SSH details; **PG plist and `.ncx`
  mapping** in the importer (with unsupported providers).
- **Done when.** The user can import or create a PG connection (direct or over SSH), open
  databases and schemas in the tree, browse tables, views, materialized views, functions (with
  overloads), sequences and types, view table data, run multi-statement scripts with `$$`
  functions in a tab that keeps `BEGIN`/`SET`/temp tables between runs, commit or roll back from
  the toolbar, get schema-aware completion that keeps `public` extensions visible, see notices,
  and cancel a long query. The guard catches a writable CTE and `pg_terminate_backend`, and a
  read on production never commits the user's transaction. PG stays behind the preview flag.

### P2b. PostgreSQL: editing and design

- **Scope.** Grid editing with default/identity omission, `RETURNING *` refresh, typed binds,
  enum dropdown, JSON editor, large-value viewer (`db:cellValue`), PK-less tables read-only
  (open question 6); editable query results; table designer (identity, serial recognition,
  runtime type picker with arrays, `USING`, comments, options tab, `ADD VALUE` pre-step, one
  transaction); DDL editor templates (`$$`, `DROP TRIGGER … ON`); sequences (current value,
  `setval`); matview refresh; truncate with restart identity/cascade; extensions list;
  `NewDatabaseDialog` PG options; object list columns; `InfoPanel` details.
- **Done when.** The user can insert into a table with a serial/identity column leaving it empty,
  edit and delete rows with a PK, edit enum/JSON/array cells without losing their text form,
  create and alter a table in one transaction (including adding an enum value used as a
  default), set a sequence value, refresh a materialized view, and truncate with restart
  identity. PG's preview flag is switched off.

### P3. SQLite (parallel with P2b once P2a's tab-session layer exists)

- **Scope.** `node:sqlite` core, utility-process worker (cap 4), RPC client with fake spawner;
  open-never-creates and path checks; "Nuevo archivo SQLite…" (`app:pickSaveFile`); read-only
  rules (production, unwritable file) and "Reabrir en modo escritura"; `foreignKeys` option;
  tree from `PRAGMA database_list` with `indexes` group; rowid identity for every rowid table;
  storage classes; logical tab sessions with "Hay una transacción abierta en otra pestaña";
  cancel message and re-applied attachments/`initialQueries`; dialect with the PRAGMA whitelist
  and `WITH … DELETE` rule; designer with the extended rebuild; `VACUUM INTO` copy option; menu
  actions (integrity check, VACUUM, Mostrar en Finder); **SQLite plist/`.ncx` mapping**
  (foreign paths flagged); `engines.node >=24`; packaged smoke on three platforms (15.4).
- **Done when.** The user can open an existing `.db` or create a new one (a mistyped path or a
  Windows path from an `.ncx` never creates a file), browse tables, views, indexes and triggers,
  edit rows by rowid, run scripts with trigger bodies, cancel a runaway CTE in under a second
  with a clear message, and alter a table that needs a rebuild with **data intact, the
  AUTOINCREMENT high-water mark kept, dependent views recreated, and pre-existing FK violations
  reported but not blocking**. The packaged smoke passes on macOS, Windows and Linux. SQLite's
  preview flag is switched off.

### P4a. MongoDB: connect, browse, edit, read queries

- **Scope.** Driver with credentials in `auth`, timeouts, `retryWrites`, extra options denylist,
  SRV ⇒ TLS, member-role detection; tree with collections/views and stats columns; collection
  browser (filter/sort/projection with history, three modes, typed inline editors, dates
  UTC/local, ObjectId copy, "Cargar más"); document editing with the replace-safety rule,
  optimistic check, whole-array `$set`, dotted/`$` field refusal, insert/duplicate/delete,
  read-only reasons; read-only index panel; **basic query editor for reads** (`find`,
  `aggregate` without `$out`/`$merge`, `countDocuments`, `distinct`, read-only commands,
  pasted-snippet tolerance) with completion and `killOp` cancel; tab sessions (`use <db>`);
  **MongoDB plist/`.ncx` mapping** (DocumentDB/Cosmos `retryWrites=false`).
- **Done when.** The user can import or create a connection (standalone, replica set, SRV; SSH to
  a single host), browse databases and collections, filter, sort and project, page with "Cargar
  más", edit fields inline and whole documents **without changing BSON types or deleting unseen
  fields**, insert, duplicate and delete documents, see indexes, and run read queries and
  `db.stats()`-style commands with completion. Production confirmation applies to every write.

### P4b. MongoDB: write queries, aggregation builder, collection designer

- **Scope.** Write methods and `bulkWrite` in the editor (guarded); `mongo:aggregate` with the
  stage builder and per-stage preview; collection designer (index create/drop, `$jsonSchema`
  validator, options read-only); "Generar esquema"; insert templates from sampled fields;
  "Contar exacto", rename and empty collection actions.
- **Done when.** The user can run `db.orders.updateMany(...)` with confirmation on production,
  build a pipeline stage by stage with previews, manage indexes and the validator. MongoDB's
  preview flag is switched off.

### P5. MariaDB as its own engine

- **Scope.** `mariadb` engine entry in the picker; `dialects/mariadb.ts` (`/*M!`, `RETURNING`);
  sequences group via `db:objects` and `SHOW CREATE SEQUENCE`; `MariaSQL` CodeMirror dialect;
  ed25519/parsec auth plugins (open question 4) with the `@noble/*` ESM check in a packaged app;
  MariaDB plist/`.ncx` mapping (`MariaDB` section → `mariadb`).
- **Done when.** A MariaDB connection created from the picker or imported can be browsed, edited
  and designed, including sequences and an ed25519 user; backup and automation entries are absent
  for it; existing `mysql` connections to MariaDB servers are unchanged. MariaDB's preview flag
  is switched off.

## 18. Open questions for the user

1. **Navicat samples, needed now (before P2a's import is finished).** Can you provide anonymised
   dummy connections of each type (PostgreSQL with verify-full, SQLite with an attachment,
   MongoDB replica set and SRV with each auth mechanism, MariaDB) as `conn.plist` excerpts and
   `.ncx`, or approve installing a Navicat Premium trial to create them? Several PG and MongoDB
   encodings are Low confidence.
2. **v0.1.x maintenance.** OK to create `release/0.1.x` from `v0.1.0`? Should x64 macOS,
   Windows and Linux artifacts be built from `v0.1.0` and attached to the release?
3. Does an `.ncx` exported from your Mac with "Export Password" ticked include the passwords?
   One manual export answers it and lets PN be accepted with real data.
4. MariaDB `ed25519`/`parsec` users: ship the verified mysql2 auth plugins (+ `@noble/curves`)
   in P5? Recommended yes.
5. **Resolved (v0.2.0).** The Navicat Keychain recovery was removed; `.ncx` is the password
   route.
6. PostgreSQL tables without a primary key: read-only with a warning (proposed for v1), or
   editing via `ctid` with a refresh after each save?
7. MongoDB over SSH: is single host with `directConnection` acceptable for v1, with the
   SOCKS5-over-SSH bridge for replica sets and Atlas SRV later?
8. Is it acceptable to mark as unsupported: MongoDB Kerberos, AWS IAM and OIDC; encrypted SQLite
   files; and Redshift, GaussDB/openGauss and KingbaseES connections?
9. **CI and test machines.** Add GitHub Actions (`npm run check` plus integration with service
   containers), or keep the local required gate? Is a Windows machine or VM available for the
   packaged smoke?
10. A `mysql` connection on a MariaDB server: keep backups with a pre-backup warning about
    skipped system-versioned tables and sequences (proposed), or refuse such backups?
11. MySQL query tabs: keep today's per-run sessions in v1 (proposed), or plan opt-in MySQL tab
    sessions (with `KILL QUERY` cancel) right after P4b?
12. SQLite foreign keys: off for opened/imported files and on for files created here
    (proposed)?
13. PostgreSQL and MongoDB user/role screens: confirm they are out of v1, or should a read-only
    roles list be included in P2b?
14. App Store (sandboxed) Navicat builds: should the importer also look under
    `~/Library/Containers/<bundle>/Data/...`? Unverified; a folder picker covers it meanwhile.

## 19. Sources

- **The project's own code**, read for the coupling map (every MySQL assumption in `src/`, cited
  as "coupling §n") and the driver feasibility checks (Electron 44.3.0 / Node 24.20.0 / SQLite
  3.53.4 against `postgres:17`, `mariadb:11` and `mongo:8.2` containers, cited as "drivers §n").
  The working notes behind both are kept outside the repository; the `pg-introspect.sql` catalog
  queries go into `src/main/postgres/catalog.ts` in P2a.
- **The user's own Navicat files**: `conn.plist`, `pref.plist`, batch jobs and `.nb3` backups the
  user created with their own Navicat for MySQL installation, documented in
  `docs/navicat-storage.md` (key names and layout only; the test fixtures are synthetic).
- **`.ncx` files exported with Navicat's own export** (Export Password), for the `.ncx` attributes,
  versions and `ConnType` values (open question 3).
- **Public documentation**: the Navicat manuals for macOS, Windows and Linux; the node:sqlite docs
  (https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/sqlite.html); the documentation of each driver
  (`pg`, `mongodb`, `mysql2`).

Reviews answered by revision 2 (session notes, not in the repo; every point is listed in
section 20): an adversarial review of regressions, guard bypasses, security and packaging, with
a SQLite 3.53.4 reproduction of the `PRAGMA query_only(0)` bypass, the view-breaks-rebuild
failure and the create-on-open behaviour; and a daily-use review for PostgreSQL, SQLite and
MongoDB.

Repo files read for this design: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/navicat-storage.md`, `package.json`,

### 20.3 MySQL-visible changes in this plan

Invariant 1 allows only these, each additive and named in release notes:

- P1a: tree node ids are escaped, so names containing `:` work; persisted tree expansion resets
  once.
- P1a: `deleteAll` also removes `sslKey` secrets (none exist for MySQL yet).
- P1b: on **MariaDB servers only**, system-versioned tables are listed, defaults are unquoted,
  users come from `global_priv`, the count timeout works, and backups warn about skipped
  objects.
- PN: Navicat import gains `.ncx`, per-type preview rows and `(type, name)` identity; existing
  MySQL imports without `navicatType` keep matching as `MySQL`.
- P1a: `SettingsDialog` shows the "Motores en vista previa" switch (off by default, so nothing
  else changes). From the first engine phase, the "Nueva conexión" entry becomes an engine
  picker when previews are on, and always once an engine leaves preview.
